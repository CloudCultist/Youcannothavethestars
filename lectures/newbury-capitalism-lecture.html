          <h1>“In Defense of Liberty”</h1>
          <p><strong>Guest Lecture / Opinion</strong> — Professor Oscar Newbury, UC Berkeley</p>
          <p><em>Originally delivered as a campus forum address, 2032</em></p>

        <p>I was thirty-two when Edward Liu was elected president. I cast my ballot for him proudly, and I’d do it again. For a brief moment, America remembered what liberty actually meant: a government that stepped back, citizens who stepped forward, and a nation willing to trust itself again.</p>

        <p>Critics call me delusional. They say the Liberty Party died in the fallout of the Great Recession and the Saavedra Incident. But I reject this revisionist history, and I reject the idea that one tragic event, no matter how severe, erases the foundational principles of our movement.</p>

        <p>Let’s talk about what really happened. The Great Recession wasn’t born in Liberty reforms, it was the inevitable result of decades of socialist overreach, bloated subsidies, and regulators choking off initiative. Liberty simply pulled back the curtain and said: let workers, innovators, and entrepreneurs lead. We cleared the way for growth. Did that transition expose weaknesses? Yes. But weakness doesn’t mean the principle was wrong, it means we waited too long to act.</p>

        <p>And as for the Saavedra Incident? That was not an ideological failure, it was a failure of execution. A private contractor cut corners, yes. But why did they have to? Because a Democratic-majority Congress refused to fund proper oversight and because entrenched bureaucrats spent years wringing their hands instead of making decisions. The Liberty administration moved fast because delay meant decay. Did we put too much faith in industry to deliver? Perhaps. But what was the alternative? Another federal mega-project, mired in committee, devouring resources, and producing nothing?</p>

        <p>Where were the watchdogs who were supposed to sound alarms? Where was the press that now smugly declares itself vindicated? No one dares admit the truth: the Saavedra tragedy was weaponized, not analyzed. Our opponents seized it as a gift. They declared Liberty discredited and used the dead to justify an unprecedented expansion of state power. Industries were nationalized overnight. New “accountability boards” sprouted like weeds. Bureaucrats who had failed in silence suddenly found their voices, so long as those voices echoed the Socialist chorus.</p>

        <p>That is not justice. That is opportunism.</p>

        <p>Liberty was never about blind trust. It was about unleashing innovation where government bloat had smothered progress. It was about recognizing that the state should be a referee, not a player; a partner, not a master. The idea that one company’s mistake invalidates the entire philosophy is no different than saying one crooked union boss discredits the entire labor movement. It is a convenient lie, repeated until believed.</p>

        <p>I remain a Liberty man because I still believe in individual choice, market dynamism, and restraint in government. I still believe that free citizens build better futures than committees of experts. The Socialist wave that followed Saavedra was not born of reason but of fear, fear dressed up as morality. It is easy to promise safety in exchange for control. It is harder to preserve freedom in the face of panic.</p>

        <p>And Liberty is not dead. It lives on in our classrooms, in our research, in every citizen who refuses to believe that the state must run their lives to protect them from their own supposed ignorance. Liberty is alive in the young economists who dare to challenge orthodoxy, in the think tanks that refuse to bow to conformity, in the millions who know instinctively that central planners cannot account for the spark of human ambition.</p>

        <p>So yes, I still believe in Liberty. I believe in its ideals even when others mock them. And I’ll keep fighting to remind this country what it looks like to stand on principle, even when the winds blow in the opposite direction.</p>
