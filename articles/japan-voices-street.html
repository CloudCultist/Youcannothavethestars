        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“My boy is coming home. That's all that matters.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Margaret O'Sullivan, factory worker, Detroit, Michigan</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“Four years he's been gone. Four years of waiting for telegrams, of praying every night. I don't care about politics or who won what. Jimmy's alive and he's coming home. That's victory enough for me.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Hull did the right thing. We didn't need to become monsters to win.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Father Michael Kowalski, parish priest, Chicago, Illinois</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I've buried too many boys from this neighborhood. If there was another way to end this war without more killing, then God bless President Hull for finding it. Some victories aren't worth the price they ask.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Five more months of dying because Hull's too soft for the hard choices.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Robert Harrison, defense plant supervisor, Los Angeles, California</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“My nephew died on Kyushu in November. November! Three months after we could have ended this whole thing in a flash. How many more boys died because the President wanted to keep his conscience clean?”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“The Japs fought to the end. You got to respect that, even if they were wrong.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Sergeant Tony Ricci, recently returned veteran, Boston, Massachusetts</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I was on Okinawa. Saw what they'd do rather than surrender. When I heard they finally gave up, I'll be honest, I was surprised. But maybe that Emperor of theirs finally saw sense. War's over. That's what counts.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Now comes the hard part. Making peace stick.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Dr. Helen Washington, college professor, Atlanta, Georgia</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“Winning a war is one thing. Building a lasting peace is another entirely. President Hull says we'll help them rebuild. I pray we're wiser this time than we were after the last war in Europe.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“My husband's ship is finally turning around.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Dorothy Chen, shipyard worker, Oakland, California</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“Got the letter yesterday. The USS Yorktown is coming home after three years in the Pacific. I've been working double shifts building ships for this war. Now maybe I can remember what it's like to be just a wife instead of a riveter.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Emperor or no emperor, they're still the enemy.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Bill Morrison, American Legion member, Phoenix, Arizona</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I fought them in the Philippines in '42. Lost half my unit to their prison camps. Just because they surrendered doesn't mean I'm ready to shake hands and forget. Some things you don't forgive.”</p>
