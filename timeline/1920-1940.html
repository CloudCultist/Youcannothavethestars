   <h2>Alternate United States Timeline: 1920–1940</h2>
  <ul class="timeline-list">
    <li><strong>May 30, 1920 –</strong> In a series of backroom negotiations, Democratic Party leaders agree to renominate President Woodrow Wilson for a third term. Unbeknownst to them, Wilson has been concealing the debilitating stroke he suffered the previous October.</li>
    <li><strong>June 12, 1920 –</strong> The Republican National Convention in Chicago adjourns without selecting a nominee after days of deadlocked balloting between General Leonard Wood and Governor Frank Lowden. In an unprecedented move, both men declare they will take their campaigns directly to the people, beginning a whirlwind of rallies, speeches, and whistle-stop tours across the country.</li>
    <li><strong>June 28, 1920 –</strong> In a stunning break from tradition, President Woodrow Wilson is nominated for an unprecedented third term on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, with near-unanimous delegate support. The debilitating stroke he suffered the previous October remains unknown to the public.</li>
    <li><strong>July–October 1920 –</strong> Across the nation, labor unrest in steel mills, coalfields, and railroad hubs fuels support for Eugene Debs' Socialist platform. Women, newly enfranchised by the 19th Amendment, prepare to vote in their first national election. Returning World War I veterans drive debates over pensions, jobs, and housing, while a mild postwar recession affects commodity prices and employment.</li>
    <li><strong>October 15, 1920 –</strong> News breaks that President Woodrow Wilson is seriously incapacitated from the stroke he suffered the previous October, shocking the public and dramatically weakening support for his reelection.</li>
    <li><strong>November 2, 1920 –</strong> Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist candidate running from federal prison, wins the presidency in an unprecedented three-way race against the fractured Republican and Democratic parties. Seymour Stedman is elected Vice President, marking the beginning of America's socialist transformation.</li>
    <li><strong>March 4, 1921 –</strong> President Debs is inaugurated while still incarcerated under the Espionage Act. His first official acts include pardoning himself and all imprisoned war resisters, then pushing Congress for sweeping labor reforms despite fierce conservative opposition.</li>
    <li><strong>April 20, 1921 –</strong> President Debs begins advocating for U.S. membership in the League of Nations, citing commitments to anti-imperialism and international labor solidarity. However, fierce congressional opposition from isolationist Republicans and conservative Democrats blocks immediate action on the proposal.</li>
    <li><strong>June 30, 1922 –</strong> The Public Works Labor Act passes Congress, guaranteeing living wages and health benefits for workers on federal infrastructure projects. This landmark legislation represents the first major Socialist victory, establishing worker-centered governance as national policy.</li>
    <li><strong>April 10, 1923 –</strong> President Debs is assassinated by Charles Farnsworth, a radicalized businessman, during a steelworkers' rally in Chicago. Vice President Seymour Stedman assumes the presidency amid nationwide mourning and massive worker strikes involving over 5 million Americans.</li>
    <li><strong>May 1923 –</strong> Federal investigations uncover the "Businessman's Plot," revealing industrialist conspiracies to sabotage the Socialist administration. Public outrage over the assassination strengthens support for socialist governance and accelerates the party's political dominance.</li>
    <li><strong>February 5, 1924 –</strong> President Stedman signs the American Cooperative Bank Act, granting credit unions and consumer cooperatives access to national reserve funds, fundamentally restructuring the nation's financial system away from private banking interests.</li>
    <li><strong>November 4, 1924 –</strong> Stedman wins election in his own right while the Socialist Party surges to near-plurality control of the House and holds 30 Senate seats. With this expanded mandate, Stedman immediately moves to fulfill Debs' vision of international socialist leadership.</li>
    <li><strong>February 15, 1925 –</strong> The United States formally joins the League of Nations under President Stedman's leadership. Stedman frames membership as essential for spreading socialist ideals globally and countering capitalist imperialism, arguing that America must use its international influence to promote workers' rights, cooperative economics, and anti-colonial movements worldwide.</li>
    <li><strong>September 3, 1925 –</strong> The People's Bank replaces the Federal Reserve, establishing centralized cooperative economic planning under public ownership. This restructuring prioritizes worker needs over private capital accumulation during a period of global economic instability.</li>
    <li><strong>April 3, 1925 –</strong> Public Radio One begins broadcasting union-sponsored cultural and educational programming nationwide. Within five years, the station reaches most American households, becoming a powerful platform for promoting socialist values and worker solidarity.</li>
    <li><strong>July 4, 1927 –</strong> Construction begins on Unity Square in St. Louis, a monumental government complex symbolizing the cooperative state. The project employs thousands through the expanding National Labor Corps while serving as a physical manifestation of socialist governance.</li>
    <li><strong>1927 –</strong> The "Short Depression" strikes as rapid nationalization and global commodity collapse trigger economic instability. The government responds with the National Labor Corps (employing over 400,000 workers) and banking reforms, demonstrating socialism's ability to manage economic crises.</li>
    <li><strong>1928 –</strong> The League of Nations relocates its headquarters from Geneva to New York City, solidifying America's leadership in international labor diplomacy and marking the nation's transformation from isolationist to global socialist leader.</li>
    <li><strong>October 9, 1929 –</strong> The National Recovery Securities Act places key financial sectors under partial public ownership, buffering the U.S. economy against the global stock market crash and Great Depression that devastates capitalist nations.</li>
    <li><strong>March 20, 1930 –</strong> The Pan-American Peace Conference produces the Western Hemisphere Workers' Accord, standardizing labor protections across 14 nations and establishing the United States as the hemisphere's leader in workers' rights advocacy.</li>
    <li><strong>March 3, 1931 –</strong> The American Railways Federation consolidates all nationalized rail systems, cutting passenger fares by 40% and doubling ridership within three years while connecting rural communities to urban economic centers.</li>
    <li><strong>August 23, 1932 –</strong> The National Negro Congress is founded by Black labor leaders, pushing for civil rights and economic justice with Socialist Party backing, strengthening the integration of racial equality into the broader socialist agenda.</li>
    <li><strong>June 6, 1934 –</strong> The Rural Access and Electrification Act brings electric power, telephony, and high-speed rail to underserved regions, transforming rural America and reducing the urban-rural economic divide that had persisted for decades.</li>
    <li><strong>June 30, 1934 –</strong> The California General Strike ends in complete victory for agricultural laborers, achieving full unionization of the West Coast farming sector and inspiring similar labor organizing efforts across the nation's agricultural regions.</li>
    <li><strong>November 6, 1936 –</strong> Norman Thomas wins election as the third Socialist president, making disability rights a cornerstone of his domestic policy while championing accessibility, workplace accommodations, and inclusive education as fundamental American values.</li>
    <li><strong>May 1, 1937 –</strong> The United States imposes a comprehensive embargo on Francoist Spain, signaling America's commitment to "Red Internationalist" diplomacy in defense of global human rights and democratic socialist movements abroad.</li>
    <li><strong>March 11, 1938 –</strong> Congress passes the People's Protection Act, the nation's first federal anti-lynching law, criminalizing racially motivated mob violence and marking a significant victory in the ongoing struggle for civil rights.</li>
    <li><strong>September 1, 1939 –</strong> As Germany invades Poland and World War II begins, the United States maintains official neutrality while providing large-scale material support to both the Soviet Union and Western Allies under President Thomas's anti-fascist foreign policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Early 1940 –</strong> With the world on the brink of total war, domestic debate intensifies over America's socialist policies, international alliances, and global leadership role as the nation prepares for potential entry into the conflict against fascism.</li>
