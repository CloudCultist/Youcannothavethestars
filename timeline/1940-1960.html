        <h1>Socialist America Timeline: 1940–1960</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
        This timeline covers the Hull-Eisenhower-Wallace Era, where democratic socialism defined 
        America’s war effort, postwar recovery, and early Cold War diplomacy. 
        These two decades laid the foundations for cooperative internationalism, 
        economic transformation, and technological progress in <em>You Cannot Have the Stars</em>.

        <h3>1940</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>November 5 –</strong> Democrat Cordell Hull is elected president, ending two decades of Socialist rule. 
          As tensions escalate in Europe with the rise of Nazism, many Americans fear the Socialist Party would be too 
          lenient toward fascist aggression due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and close U.S.-USSR relations. 
          The Republican Party, having drifted rightward and appearing sympathetic to authoritarian regimes, fails to 
          regain public trust. Voters turn to the Democratic Party as a moderate alternative, cementing its role as primary opposition. 
          The marginalized Republican Party gradually fades from national relevance.

          war on Germany and Italy on December 11, solidifying the U.S.-USSR alliance.
