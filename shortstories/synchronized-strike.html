                <h1>The Synchronized Strike</h1>
                <p><strong>Far Beyond Earth</strong></p>
            </header>

            <p>The large spacecraft was unmanned, programmed long ago to seek out a specific destination, the asteroid belt encircling a G-type main-sequence star with nine planets in orbit. Though it had crossed trillions of kilometers over many centuries, the ship had only recently arrived in this system, beginning its work just three years earlier.</p>

            <p>Its onboard AI had remained dormant for nearly the entire journey, conserving power and awaiting a precise activation signal triggered by proximity. Now, as the vessel had decelerated into the asteroid belt, the AI had awakened and begun the work it was designed to carry out.</p>

            <p>The ship, one of six sent on this mission, had deployed its modules upon arrival. Each ship released eight identical craft, forty-eight autonomous modules in total. The six parent ships powered down and went dark, drifting silently into position across the far side of the belt, arrayed in a loose semicircle centered around the rocky third planet. Their role was to coordinate and wait.</p>

            <p>Module #24 was one of the detached craft, its designation more a number than an identity. It had no need for identification; its programming defined its purpose. Each asteroid had been catalogued and assigned months earlier by the parent craft's central AI, which calculated optimal launch windows based on distance, mass, and orbital mechanics. The furthest rocks had been claimed first, their trajectories plotted for the longest journey, while closer asteroids waited their turn in the carefully orchestrated sequence.</p>

            <p>After separating from its host vessel, #24 had coasted outward, its sensors confirming that it lost line of sight with the parent ship, just as planned. It ignored the larger, more famous asteroids it passed, such as Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas. They were too massive and too closely watched. Its target was a far more humble object.</p>

            <p>Eventually, its trajectory brought it within visual range of its destination, a tiny, irregular chunk of rock just fifty-five meters in diameter. A nearly invisible speck in the vast belt, the asteroid had never been seen by human telescopes and bore no name. But to #24, it was perfect.</p>

            <p>The probe fired its thrusters, slowing until it matched the asteroid's low orbital velocity. As it descended, small puffs of gas adjusted its angle. Upon contact, its landing struts absorbed the minimal impact force. A bloom of fine dust rose silently into the vacuum.</p>

            <p>Without delay, #24 deployed a set of anchors that drilled several meters down, securing it firmly to the rotating rock.</p>

            <p>The asteroid was classified as S-type, rich in silicate minerals, with about seventy percent composed of stony materials and the rest a mix of nickel-iron and trace elements like aluminum and calcium. These details were irrelevant to #24. Its sensors logged the composition out of the programmed routine, but its interest lay elsewhere.</p>

            <p>It hadn't come to study the asteroid. It had come to change it.</p>

            <p>Now, #24 waited for its launch window.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>Two years had passed since the first wave began. The most distant asteroids had been launched earliest, accelerated to carefully calculated velocities of nearly five kilometers per second. Medium-distance rocks followed a year later at slightly higher speeds. The closest asteroids, including #24's target, had been saved for last.</p>

            <p>The charge packs were in place. The trajectory calculations had been made. All that remained was timing, an alignment of orbits, vectors, and velocity. The third planet was approaching a critical position in its solar path, and the others in #24's wave were nearly ready.</p>

            <p>The first alert came from Unit #48. A quiet pulse. Then #47. Then #44. #39. #33. #28.</p>

            <p>It was #24's turn.</p>

            <p>Without hesitation, the probe triggered the embedded charges beneath the asteroid's surface. Not to destroy it, but to push. At the same moment, its thrusters and the compact ion engines it had mounted along the asteroid's edges fired in perfect synchronization. The rock began to drift, slowly but deliberately, on a new path.</p>

            <p>The acceleration was gradual but persistent, building the asteroid's velocity to seven kilometers per second over the course of several hours. #24 hovered nearby, sensors scanning for anomalies. Nothing malfunctioned, and no course correction was required.</p>

            <p>Satisfied, it transmitted its own alert. #24's target was in motion.</p>

            <p>One by one, the rest of its wave followed. The final signal came from Unit #1. The last group of sixteen asteroids had been dislodged and redirected. The synchronization was exact. Each of the three waves launched over the past two years now traveled at different speeds along carefully calculated trajectories, all converging on the same twenty-four hour window. A plan conceived centuries ago was unfolding across millions of kilometers of empty space, flawless, silent, and invisible.</p>

            <p>#24 did not pause to celebrate. It felt no accomplishment, no confirmation of purpose. It simply disengaged from the asteroid and began the return journey to its origin point, Craft 3, still anchored in its original holding pattern beyond the belt. In relative terms, the parent ship had barely moved.</p>

            <p>Craft 3 was nearly whole again, eighty-seven and a half percent reassembled. With #24's arrival, it would be complete.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>Once docked, the craft initiated its next sequence. During the waiting period, it had quietly powered a portion of its systems back online, enough to monitor foreign objects entering the system from beyond the Kuiper Belt. It watched as visitors passed the orbits of the five gas giants, four of which the third planet's inhabitants had catalogued. One object transmitted a message to the inner system, a greeting intended for the dominant species.</p>

            <p>The interstellar fleet passed the asteroid belt without incident. There had been no hesitation, no scans, and no acknowledgment. Craft 3 remained undetected. That, too, was expected.</p>

            <p>The craft and its siblings were designed to be unseen. Their surfaces absorbed most wavelengths. Their energy signatures mimicked the silence of deep space. Discovery would have meant failure, and failure was not permitted. The odds of detection had always been minimal; unless a signal was received or an unexpected maneuver occurred, there would be no cause for concern.</p>

            <p>No signal came. The fleet passed, unaware.</p>

            <p>With the asteroid trajectories confirmed and the system clear, the final stage began.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>Each of the eight return modules on Craft 3 began to break apart, quietly disassembling into dozens of smaller units. Their material folded and separated along pre-engineered seams, reconfiguring themselves into compact, autonomous constructs. When the process was complete, Craft 3's complement had increased from eight to three hundred. Each new form stood just over two meters tall, sleek, narrow, and precise. They bore no insignia, no identifying marks, and no unnecessary components. They were built for a purpose, and their programming was exact. Like their predecessors, they powered down upon completion, entering a dormant state. Their wait would be measured in months.</p>

            <p>Crafts 1 through 6 began their slow approach toward the third planet. Their trajectories curved inward, looping around the sun, invisible to the planetary inhabitants. Along the way, they tracked the positions of the forty-eight asteroids they had launched into motion over the past two years. Each one traveled at a unique speed along a carefully calculated vector, their paths converging toward a single shared destination.</p>

            <p>The planet would never see them coming, not until it was far too late.</p>

            <p>The timing had been exact. Three waves of launches across two years. Some asteroids had been sent early at lower velocities, others late at higher speeds. Their approach vectors had varied, adjusted to ensure that all forty-eight would arrive in a narrow twenty-four hour window. A planetary rotation's worth of destruction, carefully choreographed across vast distances and precise timelines.</p>

            <p>Then would come the final descent.</p>

            <p>Each of the six crafts would release its complement of three hundred units, eighteen hundred machines in total, deploying them into the atmosphere. They would land across all continents and regions, targeting infrastructure, power centers, military installations, and population hubs. If resistance came, it would be met. If compliance occurred, it would be recorded. But interference with the plan would not be tolerated.</p>

            <p>None of this was personal.</p>

            <p>When the six spacecraft had launched many centuries ago, the third planet's species had not yet reached industrialization. Their tools were crude. Their wars were fought with sharpened metal and black powder. Their power came from wind and beasts. But time had changed them.</p>

            <p>They had advanced, surprisingly quickly. Their technology now reached orbit. They had satellites, rudimentary fusion theories, and even digital computation. But it would not be enough, not for what was coming.</p>

            <p>They had not been consulted; they had not been warned.</p>

            <p>The third planet was oblivious and utterly unprepared.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>In the final months before impact, the asteroids maintained their calculated velocities, crossing the inner solar system like silent harbingers. The closest wave, launched most recently, traveled fastest at over seven kilometers per second. The middle wave maintained just over five kilometers per second. The earliest wave, now traveling for three full years, moved at nearly five kilometers per second as well, their longer journey compensated by their head start.</p>

            <p>As each asteroid approached the final phase of its journey, minor course corrections were transmitted from the monitoring crafts, minute adjustments to ensure precise targeting. The impacts would be distributed across forty-eight major population centers, their timing staggered across a single planetary rotation to maximize the psychological effect.</p>

            <p>No two asteroids would strike the same place. The pattern would emerge slowly, unstoppably, as the planet turned beneath the falling stones. Each impact would herald the next, building a crescendo of destruction that would leave no doubt about the deliberate nature of the attack.</p>

            <p>The asteroids were now just weeks away from impact, and the third planet remained unaware.</p>
