        <h1>United States Joins League of Nations</h1>
        <h3>Socialist Congress Ratifies Membership in Historic Vote</h3>
      </header>

      <p><strong>Washington, March 14 —</strong> The United States has formally entered the League of Nations. The Senate last evening ratified the revised Covenant by a vote of 52 to 44, giving President Seymour Stedman his first major triumph in foreign affairs and marking a decisive break from the isolation of the past.</p>

      <p>The House of Representatives, where Socialist majorities are stronger, had already given approval by wide margin. The Senate contest was closer, but after hours of fiery debate the administration prevailed.</p>

      <p>President Stedman, addressing reporters at the White House, hailed the decision as “a fulfillment of our obligation to the workers and oppressed peoples of the world.” He declared: “Where President Debs built the foundations of socialism here at home, we now extend that vision abroad. American labor cannot stand secure while workers in other lands remain bound under imperialism.”</p>

      <h3>League Covenant Recast</h3>

      <p>Membership came only after long negotiations in Geneva. American envoys pressed for changes to the League Covenant, and these were secured. The new articles recognize labor rights and economic justice as guiding principles; open the door for colonized peoples to bring their petitions before the League; and denounce profiteering from war. The Covenant also creates new machinery for settling trade and financial disputes among nations.</p>

      <p>Senator Morris Hillquit of New York, who led the fight in the upper chamber, said after the vote: “We do not enter as another great power among the rest. We enter as the tribune of the working class, to give voice to those long unheard.”</p>

      <h3>Delegation of a New Kind</h3>

      <p>The United States delegation to Geneva will be unlike any before. President Stedman announced that alongside diplomats, the mission will include labor organizers, cooperative leaders, and advocates of the Negro people. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois is named among them, together with William Z. Foster of the steelworkers. Secretary of State Scott Nearing will head the delegation.</p>

      <p>“No longer shall diplomacy be the province of bankers and munitions men,” the President said. “The sons and daughters of toil will take their rightful place at the councils of peace.”</p>

      <h3>Europe Reacts</h3>

      <p>In London, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald welcomed the American decision, calling it “a bold step toward cooperation among peoples.” In Paris, the reaction was more reserved. French officials expressed doubt over the presence of trade unionists at the conference table.</p>

      <h3>Opposition at Home</h3>

      <p>Conservative leaders denounced the action. The Chamber of Commerce warned that “foreign entanglements will fasten alien doctrines upon our Republic.” Former President Harding, speaking at Marion, Ohio, declared it “a betrayal of Washington’s counsel.”</p>

      <p>Yet the mood in the nation’s great industrial cities was celebratory. In Detroit, auto workers paraded through the streets behind banners reading “International Solidarity Now.” Socialist journals greeted the vote as the dawn of a new era.</p>

      <h3>New Course for America</h3>

      <p>With her entrance into the League, the United States becomes at once its most powerful member, both in population and in wealth. Observers believe the move will give the League new vigor and may tilt its course toward anti-imperialism.</p>

      <p>Dr. Du Bois, tapped to serve on the Colonial Affairs Committee, said: “For the first time, the voice of the darker peoples will be heard in a council of nations.”</p>

      <p>President Stedman signaled more to come. “This is but the first step,” he told correspondents. “Our task is not to dominate the League, but to transform it. The world’s workers have waited long enough for their seat at the table of peace.”</p>
