        <h1>About You Cannot Have the Stars</h1>
      </header>

      <p><strong>You Cannot Have the Stars</strong> is the debut novel of Shawn Lyons, an author fascinated by the intersection of history, politics, and speculative futures. The novel grew from a question: What if one pivotal moment in history had changed the entire course of human society?</p>

      <p>Set against a backdrop of political upheaval, personal trauma, and alien contact, the book explores how individuals and societies confront change, challenge ideology, and struggle with power. Shawn's vision imagines a world where history diverges dramatically yet retains a core humanity, asking how hope and fear coexist when everything we thought stable is uprooted.</p>

      <p>The novel’s alternate timeline begins in 1920, when Eugene V. Debs is elected U.S. president, setting in motion a century-long transformation of America into a socialist superpower. This history reshapes politics, technology, culture, and the environment — leading to breakthroughs as well as fractures that test the resilience of its people.</p>

      <p>At the heart of the narrative is an ensemble of eight deeply drawn characters, whose lives intersect across continents and crises. Their stories give voice to conflicting ideals and complex emotions — from hope to despair, loyalty to betrayal, and courage to doubt.</p>
