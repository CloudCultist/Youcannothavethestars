            <p>The alien broadcast had ended several hours ago, and the Secret Service agents were finally letting them out of the bunker. Everyone stood and left together, riding the elevator back up to the surface.</p>

            <p>When they arrived above ground, the Secret Service agent reiterated to her that she needed to keep her mouth shut about where she had been. "This area is classified." He had stopped short of threatening her, but the message had come through loud and clear.</p>

            <p>"Stewart, the congresswoman understands the gravity of the situation," President Turner said, stepping beside Tabitha. "I'm certain she knows how to keep a secret."</p>

            <p>Tabitha straightened her shoulders, grateful Turner had stepped in. The agent nodded and led them back across the White House. As they walked, several people stared at the group, their faces reflecting the same stunned disbelief that Tabitha felt coursing through her own mind.</p>

            <p>When they got back to the waiting room outside the Oval Office, Tabitha found her laptop bag exactly where she had left it. She breathed a sigh of relief, though her morning meeting about NASA funding now felt like it belonged to another lifetime.</p>

            <p>"Edward," Turner said, approaching his personal secretary's desk. "You stayed at your post through all of this?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, sir," Edward replied, his usual composure intact despite the circumstances. "Alien invasion or not, if anyone wants to get into that office, they have to come through me first."</p>

            <p>Turner managed a brief smile - the first Tabitha had seen from him since the countdown began. "I appreciate your dedication, Eddie." His expression quickly turned serious again. "I need you to contact Secretary Adebayo immediately. His expertise will be crucial for our response. Also get me the Speaker of the House and Senator Blake. We need congressional leadership briefed tonight."</p>

            <p>"I'll get right on it, sir."</p>

            <p>Turner turned to Tabitha. "Congresswoman, given your committee position, can you think of anyone else we should bring into this circle?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha hesitated. She honestly didn't know many people with the kind of expertise this situation demanded, but she didn't want to admit that to the president. "Congressman Tomas Castro. He's the ranking chair of my committee."</p>

            <p>Turner turned back to his secretary. "Add Castro's office to your list, Edward."</p>

            <p>Eddie nodded. "Yes, sir. I'll reach out to his staff once I connect with Secretary Adebayo."</p>

            <p>Turner took a deep breath and clapped his hands together. "The next few hours will be critical. We're dealing with something that will reshape everything we thought we knew about our place in the universe." He walked into the Oval Office.</p>

            <p>As she followed the president, Tabitha smiled. <em>Tomas is going to owe me for this</em>, she thought, acutely aware that her own career had just taken a turn she never could have imagined.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>Nearly an hour passed before the last person, Senator Debra Harris, arrived at the White House. Eddie Liu opened the door for her and then closed it with a soft thud. Harris looked around the room and took a spot next to Tabitha, who stared at the far wall, a small part of her mind still refusing to accept what she had experienced that day. The late afternoon light streaming through the tall windows felt different somehow, as if the very quality of sunlight had changed.</p>

            <p>To her right, Harris settled in next to Whitney Blake, her Senate colleague. Both members of the Senate Oversight Committee, they traded hushed remarks about the whirlwind events that had brought them there. Blake kept running his hand through his graying hair, a habit Tabitha had noticed he had even when he was giving speeches on the campaign trail.</p>

            <p>On her left sat Congressman Tomas Castro, the top Democrat on the House Space Technology Research Committee. When he had walked into the room, he looked right at Tabitha and smiled. She had sent a MindBeam message to him to let him know to who exactly he owed the honor of being in this life-changing meeting with the president. Several other colleagues from the House were present as well, including the Speaker, as well as the Chair and the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>

            <p>Around the room, Turner had assembled a small group of key officials which included Jessica Baldwin, Eric Parsons and Sebastian Adebayo, the Secretary of Science and Technology. Several others sat in chairs along the walls, aides and experts who might have crucial insights to add. The director of NASA was on the phone as well, unable to be present in the capital.</p>

            <p>President Turner wasted no time getting started, skipping pleasantries to get straight to business. "Secretary Adebayo assures me there isn't a nation or group on the planet with the power to hijack every single electronic device, down to the old analog radios. That kind of technology just doesn't exist." He nodded to his Science and Technology Secretary and said, "Sebastian, please, tell them what you told me."</p>

            <p>While Turner spoke, Secretary Adebayo looked around the room, meeting each person's eyes. When his gaze reached Tabitha, it lingered a moment longer than it had on the others. His dark eyes held an intensity that made her shift in her chair.</p>

            <p>"Just as I told President Turner," Adebayo said, "the broadcaster claimed the message was extraterrestrial in origin and, frankly, I can't think of any other possible explanation."</p>

            <p>When there was a small lull in the conversation, Senator Harris tried to speak, but Adebayo pressed on, either not noticing or deliberately ignoring her.</p>

            <p>"I would say this was a localized event, which would still be staggeringly improbable, but less, shall I say," he stopped, searching for a word, and then said, "inconceivable."</p>

            <p>Finally, after Adebayo was silent for a second, Senator Harris managed to ask, "What about the two voices that were in the video? Do we know who they were?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, we actually do," Secretary Parsons answered as he cleared his throat. "The American voice belonged to a former astronaut, Douglas Dunn, but he passed away some years ago. The Russian, who is actually still alive, is Cosmonaut Arkady Komarov."</p>

            <p>President Turner cut in. "I've already spoken to the Soviet Premier and he says Komarov denies any involvement with the broadcast, but they called him to Moscow anyway. After that, I requested he come here to D.C. for a few days, which Komarov accepted. When he arrives, I'll meet with him privately, then hold a press conference with him and the Soviet ambassador. For that, I'd like everyone in this room, including you, director, standing behind us as we speak to the media."</p>

            <p>"Yes, sir, Mr. President," the NASA director said, his voice crackling slightly through the speaker.</p>

            <p>Turner looked up at Tabitha and she nodded, her pulse quickening. Just like that, she had been thrust onto the national stage. Even though she had served nearly five terms in the House, she had never been able to stand out from the pack, to differentiate herself from the hundreds of other representatives who filled the chamber each day. Now standing behind the president for this momentous occasion would take her career to an entirely new level. Her palms were sweating; the thought both thrilled and terrified her.</p>

            <p>"Senator Blake," Turner said, turning his attention to the Wisconsin senator. "I know you've been critical of some of our space programs in the past, but this changes everything, doesn't it?"</p>

            <p>Blake stopped running his hand through his hair and sat forward, his elbows on his knees. "Mr. President, if this is real - and Jesus, it's hard to wrap my head around - but if it is, we need to think about what comes next. These Ru-Lima said they'd be here in a few months. Are we prepared for that? Do we have any kind of protocol?"</p>

            <p>"That's exactly why you're all here," Turner replied. "We need to approach this from every angle. Diplomatic, scientific, military, economic. The American people are going to want answers, and we'd better have them."</p>

            <p>Castro spoke up for the first time since arriving, his voice quiet but pointed. "Has there been any response from other world leaders? Are they seeing this the same way we are?"</p>

            <p>Secretary Baldwin answered, "As he said earlier, the President has spoken with Premier Volkov, the Chinese leadership, and several European allies. Everyone received the same broadcast. The League Security Council is convening an emergency session tomorrow."</p>

            <p>"What about public reaction?" Senator Harris asked, tucking a strand of gray hair behind her ear. "The phones in my office have been ringing non-stop since the broadcast ended. Half my constituents think it's the end times."</p>

            <p>Parsons grimaced. "We've been looking at reactions on both WORKNET and the regular internet and reactions seem to be all over the map. From what we gathered, about forty percent think it's a hoax or some kind of attack. Thirty percent are genuinely terrified. The rest are either excited or too shocked to process it properly."</p>

            <p>"Those numbers will shift," Turner said. "Once the reality settles in, assuming this is real, we need to be ready to lead the country through whatever comes next."</p>

            <p>Blake leaned back in his chair, his expression thoughtful. "You know, if the Ru-Lima really are coming here in peace, this could be the greatest opportunity in human history. Think about what we could learn from them, what they could teach us."</p>

            <p>"Or it could be the end of everything we know," Castro countered quietly, his hands folded in his lap. Nobody spoke for a moment. The weight of both possibilities hung in the air between them.</p>

            <p>Secretary Adebayo cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention. "Consider the technology they demonstrated today. The ability to hack into every electronic device simultaneously, that level of capability suggests they have technology beyond what we can even comprehend. A species like that would have learned to coexist in peace, just like they claimed in the broadcast."</p>

            <p>General Collins spoke up. "We can't know that."</p>

            <p>Sebastian looked at him, eyes narrowed, but said nothing.</p>

            <p>"We have to consider both sides, tackle the question of whether this is really peaceful contact," Baldwin said, her voice sharp. "A show of force like this, even if they claim it's just to get our attention – "</p>

            <p>"It's a hell of a way to introduce yourself," Parsons interrupted.</p>

            <p>Tabitha had been listening to the exchange, but now she felt compelled to speak. The words came out before she could stop them. "Mr. President, if I may. Regardless of their intentions, we need to start preparing the American people for the possibility that this is legitimate. The panic we've seen on the internet is just the beginning. If these aliens really do arrive in a few months, and we haven't prepared our citizens..."</p>

            <p>Turner nodded approvingly at her words. "Exactly right, Congresswoman. Which is why I want all of you to work on this. Blake, what can you do?"</p>

            <p>Blake cleared his throat. "I'll set up and chair a special Senate subcommittee on extraterrestrial contact. Harris will be the vice chair."</p>

            <p>Tabitha jumped in. "Tomas and I can get a parallel committee established in the House but we're not as senior in the House as Whitney is in the Senate, but if you want us heading it, sir, that's up to the Speaker."</p>

            <p>"Don't worry, Tabitha," the Speaker said, "I'll make sure you head it. You were here when it happened."</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded thanks.</p>

            <p>"Happy to have that taken care of," Turner said firmly. "Because if this is real, and I'm increasingly convinced it is, then we don't have the luxury of politics as usual, so the faster this goes, the better. Good day to be in the right place at the right time, huh?" He smiled at Tabitha as he spoke.</p>

            <p>Tabitha felt a sense of responsibility settling on her shoulders like a mantle she'd never expected to wear. Leading a House committee on extraterrestrial contact would put her at the center of the most significant event in human history. First standing behind the president, and now this? The career implications were staggering, but beyond personal advancement, she would be helping to shape humanity's response to first contact.</p>

            <p>As the meeting began to wind down and people started to stand, she caught Secretary Adebayo looking at her again. This time his expression held something different, almost like he knew something she didn't. But when she saw her looking back, he quickly looked away, and Tabitha promptly forgot about it, her mind already racing with the magnitude of what lay ahead.</p>
