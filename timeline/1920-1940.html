        <h2>Summary: 1920–1940</h2>
        <p>
          This period marked the birth and consolidation of American socialism,
          as the nation weathered the turbulence of Eugene Debs’s election, his
          assassination, and Seymour Stedman’s steady leadership. Sweeping reforms
          reshaped labor rights, finance, and infrastructure, while cooperative
          institutions replaced capitalist power centers. Despite economic shocks
          and organized resistance from industrial elites, the Socialist government
          gained legitimacy, expanded civil rights, and assumed global leadership
          within the League of Nations. By 1940, the United States had redefined
          itself as a cooperative democracy, preparing to face the mounting challenge
          of a world sliding into war.
