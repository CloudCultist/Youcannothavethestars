        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“They didn’t just shoot a man, they shot hope.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Clara Jiménez, textile worker, Paterson, New Jersey</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I saw him speak once, back in ’21, when he came through with Mrs. O’Hare. He talked like he’d known me my whole life. My mother cried. I cried. Now my daughter will grow up in a world without him. God help the men who did this.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“It won’t end with Debs. They’ll come for Stedman next.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Leroy Bateman, coal miner, Beckley, West Virginia<</strong>/figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“Don’t think this was just some nut with a gun. This was planned. They’ve been losing money since Debs took office, and the men who used to own this country don’t like being told no.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“A sad day, yes, but let’s not lose our heads.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— George T. Aldrich, banker, Springfield, Illinois</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“President Debs was a good man, but let’s not rush to blame every businessman with a suit and a cigar. We’re a nation of laws, not vengeance. Let the new President restore calm.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“I named my son after Eugene Debs. I still believe.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Rebecca Goldstein, schoolteacher, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“This country was sick with greed before he came. He gave us medicine, and they hated him for it. But my neighbors aren’t going back. Not one of us will.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“The working class is awake now. It can’t be put back to sleep.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Thomas O’Reilly, trolley conductor, New York City</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“You can see it in people’s eyes. In 1912, they laughed at Debs. In 1920, they elected him. Now? Now they’ll build statues to him. This isn’t over, it’s just begun.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“This was a warning. But to who?”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Annabelle Leclair, housekeeper, New Orleans, Louisiana</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“Maybe it was to scare folks from voting red. Maybe it was to scare the ones in Washington. But I think the message backfired. Folks are angry. And they’re not scared anymore.”</p>
