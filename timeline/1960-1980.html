  <h2>Alternate United States Timeline: 1960–1980</h2>
  <ul class="timeline-list">
    <li><strong>November 1960 –</strong> Socialist Eric Hass is elected president on a platform of universal health care and deep international cooperation with newly independent nations emerging from decolonization. Hass's victory represents a return to Socialist governance after the moderate Democratic presidencies of Hull and Eisenhower, with voters seeking renewed commitment to worker-centered policies and international solidarity. His running mate, civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, becomes the first openly gay candidate on a major party ticket, though this receives little public attention at the time.</li>

    <li><strong>January 20, 1961 –</strong> Hass is inaugurated with VP Bayard Rustin in a ceremony emphasizing America's role as a beacon of democratic socialism worldwide. Within his first 100 days, Hass begins implementing comprehensive health care reforms, expanding Socialist Health Boards into a national system and establishing medical cooperatives in underserved rural areas. His administration also launches the International Cooperative Exchange Program, assisting newly independent African and Asian nations seeking alternatives to both capitalist exploitation and Soviet-style centralization.</li>

    <li><strong>1962–1963 –</strong> The Red-White Star space program officially launches as the crown jewel of U.S.-Soviet scientific cooperation, with astronauts training in both Houston and Star City. The program symbolizes technological partnership between the two socialist nations despite ideological differences, proving that socialist cooperation can achieve what capitalist competition cannot.</li>

    <li><strong>December 31, 1963 –</strong> Neil Armstrong and Yuri Gagarin become the first humans to set foot on the Moon during the Red-White Star III mission. They plant American and Soviet flags side by side, delivering a joint message of peace and cooperation to 500 million viewers worldwide. Armstrong declares, "We come not as conquerors, but as representatives of all humanity's hopes," while Gagarin adds, "When workers unite, no dream is impossible."</li>

    <li><strong>May–December 1965 –</strong> Intelligence reports reveal the formation of TIIBASA (Turkey, Iran, India, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa), a covert confederation of capitalist and authoritarian states secretly sharing nuclear technology. The alliance forms to resist growing socialist influence, sparking intense pressure on President Hass to respond.</li>

    <li><strong>June 1965 –</strong> Portugal becomes the last major European colonial power to decolonize its African territories. The Hass administration launches the Cooperative Development Initiative, offering newly independent nations economic partnerships based on cooperative principles rather than exploitation.</li>

    <li><strong>1965–1966 –</strong> The USSR permits independence referenda in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Kazakhstan. All choose independence but remain in the Continental Defense Sphere, showcasing that socialism can coexist with national self-determination.</li>

    <li><strong>1966 –</strong> Congress passes the National Health Guarantee Act, enshrining universal medical care as a constitutional right. Healthcare cooperatives manage delivery while federal oversight ensures equal access nationwide.</li>

    <li><strong>January 20, 1969 –</strong> Nixon is inaugurated as a Democratic president. He emphasizes preserving socialist achievements while addressing new challenges, particularly TIIBASA’s nuclear ambitions.</li>

    <li><strong>1969 –</strong> WORKNET, a cooperative alternative to ARPANET, launches to connect universities, research centers, and worker cooperatives. It becomes a model for democratic technology development.</li>

    <li><strong>1970 –</strong> Dr. Reza Ahmadi defects from Iran, exposing TIIBASA’s coordinated nuclear program. His revelations confirm the alliance’s growing threat.</li>

    <li><strong>1971–1972 –</strong> The Nixon administration launches the People’s Computing Initiative, making affordable personal computers available to cooperatives and community centers, laying the foundation for a networked society.</li>

    <li><strong>1972 –</strong> The Red-White Star V mission establishes a permanent lunar research station. Meanwhile, consumer computers begin appearing in American homes.</li>

    <li><strong>1972–1973 –</strong> The Automation Crisis hits as computerization displaces workers. Nixon enacts the Technology Dividend Act, guaranteeing income support and retraining, ensuring automation’s benefits are shared.</li>

    <li><strong>1973 –</strong> Nixon enacts the Cooperative Defense Charter, banning unilateral U.S. military action without League of Nations approval.</li>

    <li><strong>1973–1974 –</strong> TIIBASA emerges publicly as the "Free World Defense Pact," openly opposing socialism. Meanwhile, Congress passes the Refugee Protection and Integration Act, granting asylum and cooperative membership to dissidents fleeing capitalist regimes.</li>

    <li><strong>1974–1975 –</strong> U.S., USSR, and China begin constructing underground bunker systems to ensure survival in case of nuclear war. The U.S. also implements the 30-Hour Cooperative Standard, redistributing automation gains through shorter work weeks.</li>
