        <h1>President Saavedra Impeached After Nuclear Disaster Shakes Nation</h1>
        <h3>By Alicia Norwood, Chief Political Correspondent</h3>
      </header>

      <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> In a dramatic and deeply polarized session that ran past midnight, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Jackson "Jax" Saavedra, charging him with gross negligence, dereliction of duty, and willful endangerment of the public trust. The vote — 281 to 154 — saw Socialists overwhelmingly in favor, joined by a bloc of Democrats who broke with their leadership after months of mounting public outrage.</p>

      <p>The impeachment is historic not just for its rarity but for its context. The last time a president faced such proceedings was in 1868, when Andrew Johnson survived removal in the Senate by a single vote. For the first time since then, Congress has accused a sitting president of endangering the very foundations of the republic, not through war or corruption, but through catastrophic environmental failure and economic collapse. The crisis now known as The Saavedra Incident — the October 2013 failure of a massive, privately contracted effort to dispose of America's nuclear waste in space — has already been branded by historians as one of the most consequential man-made disasters in American history.</p>

      <h3>The Road to Disaster</h3>

      <p>The origins of the Saavedra Incident stretch back years before Saavedra entered office. The problem was simple but enormous: what to do with America's growing stockpile of nuclear waste, accumulated over decades of energy production and weapons development. Public pressure had turned on nuclear energy, demanding action on its lingering waste.</p>

      <p>President Lott had initially planned to incrementally move waste to a desert facility, then launch it into the sun in a careful, phased approach. But the political winds shifted under President Edward Liu. A staunch fiscal conservative with the Liberty Party, Liu believed deeply in privatization and deregulation. Where Lott had treated waste disposal as a federal responsibility requiring careful oversight, Liu decided to change the plan from a government-managed program to a privatized contract through a lowest-bidder process.</p>

      <p>In one of his most controversial moves, Liu awarded the contract to Orion Industries, a private aerospace firm with little experience in nuclear materials management. The company abandoned incremental disposal and decided to launch all the waste at once. The plan they devised was to load the waste into containers, attach them to rockets, and launch simultaneously. This, they claimed, would be a more cost-effective strategy. Liu, a fiscal hawk, approved the plan, eager to save taxpayer money.</p>

      <p>The warehouses and rockets, the company claimed, were self-inspected to save as much money as possible. Critics, including members of both parties, objected. They urged caution, warning that cost-cutting in aerospace was no substitute for proper oversight and that staging would be far safer. But Orion and the Liu administration dismissed these concerns as bureaucratic waste.</p>

      <h3>Saavedra Takes Office</h3>

      <p>When Jackson Saavedra assumed the presidency in January 2013, he inherited both the Orion contract and the weight of public expectations. The economy had been stable under Liu, buoyed by the long tail of the so-called "Lavish Decade," but structural weaknesses loomed beneath the surface. Within three months, between February and April 2013, the economy buckled, tipping into a recession that sent unemployment soaring. By the summer, Saavedra's approval ratings were already sliding.</p>

      <p>Still, the nuclear waste program remained on track. The task had spanned administrations and was finally set to be completed under Saavedra. Advisers quietly urged Saavedra to postpone the launches until the recession stabilized, or at least to conduct additional safety reviews. But with political capital dwindling and fiscal hawks in the Liberty Party demanding proof of "efficient governance," Saavedra pressed forward. In September, he announced that the launches would proceed in October, touting them as "a triumph of American innovation over bureaucratic paralysis."</p>

      <h3>The Saavedra Incident</h3>

      <p>On October 12, 2013, the massive Orion rockets lifted off from Cape Canaveral in a simultaneous launch. Not long after take-off, two of the rockets exploded above 60,000 feet, their debris striking others and triggering a chain reaction. Toxic waste rained over a 2,000-mile-wide swath of North America, affecting portions of the southeastern United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean Islands.</p>

      <p>The devastation was immediate and staggering. Tens of thousands were displaced from contaminated zones, farmland across multiple states was declared unusable, the Atlantic fishing industry from North to South America was bankrupted, and countless ecological disasters unfolded across the affected regions. Early cleanup estimates ran into the trillions.</p>

      <p>Most chilling of all, radiation exposure affected millions. Though the long-term health effects remain unknown, experts predict waves of cancers and genetic damage for generations. Within hours, the press dubbed the catastrophe The Saavedra Incident.</p>

      <h3 class="column-break">Public Fury and Political Collapse</h3>

      <p>The recession had already eroded public patience. The Incident broke what remained of Saavedra's fragile support. Approval ratings plummeted to 18 percent, the lowest for any president in modern polling. Demonstrations erupted across major cities, demanding accountability. Farmers, fishermen, and displaced families flooded Washington with pleas for relief.</p>

      <p>Saavedra's administration appeared paralyzed. In the immediate aftermath, federal coordination lagged. States begged for resources. Congress demanded emergency sessions. By November, whistleblowers revealed that the Department of Energy had produced reports warning of rocket instability—reports that had been suppressed within the White House. The revelations fueled accusations that Saavedra had knowingly gambled with public safety for political optics.</p>

      <p>"This was preventable," thundered Representative Agnes Harrison (S–AZ). "The administration ignored science, ignored warnings, and put the nation in harm's way. That is not leadership. That is negligence."</p>

      <h3>Impeachment in the House</h3>

      <p>The House Judiciary Committee quickly drafted three articles of impeachment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Gross Negligence in National Safety</strong> — advancing the space disposal plan despite clear warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Dereliction of Duty</strong> — failing to mount a swift federal response to the crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>Willful Endangerment of Public Trust</strong> — misleading Congress and the public about oversight.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Debate was fierce but decisive. Representative Araceli Dávila (S–CA) delivered the most quoted line of the night: "President Saavedra inherited a ticking bomb and chose to let it detonate."</p>

      <p>When the final tally was read — 281 in favor, 154 against — the chamber erupted. For only the second time in American history, a sitting president stood formally impeached.</p>

      <h3>Saavedra's Defiance</h3>

      <p>The president, visibly strained, addressed the nation from the White House shortly after midnight. "I will not resign," he declared. "I did what I believed was right in the face of impossible choices. History will judge, not mobs in Congress."</p>

      <p>He blamed the disaster on "decades of bipartisan mismanagement" and insisted that the true fault lay with Orion Industries, not his administration, but few were convinced. Even Liberty Party stalwarts, long loyal to Saavedra, began distancing themselves. For the first time in its short history, the Liberty Party itself showed signs of fracture, split between fiscal conservatives who defended deregulation and populists furious at the betrayal of ordinary citizens during the recession and the Incident.</p>

      <h3>Toward the Senate Trial</h3>

      <p>Attention now turns to the Senate, where Chief Justice Justin Carswell will preside over Saavedra's trial in the new year. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote, 72 of the 108 senators. The Socialists appear united in favor of conviction. Democrats, who hold the majority in the House, are under intense pressure to join them.</p>

      <p>Historians note the parallel to 1868, when Andrew Johnson faced a Senate trial amid national crisis. Then, as now, the country stood at a crossroads, and the fate of a president hung on a handful of votes.</p>

      <h3>A Nation in Transition</h3>
      
      <p>The Saavedra Incident has reshaped the political landscape overnight. The Socialist Party, energized by public anger, has gained significant influence in the House. Grassroots movements for environmental justice, nuclear safety, and economic reform have surged. Demonstrations draw tens of thousands, united under the slogan: "Never Again Orion."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Liberty Party faces its gravest test in its history, now teetering on the edge of collapse. Its fracture is not the product of long-standing divisions, but of the dual blows of the recession and the Incident. Experts already believe the party will lose all of its representation in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

      <h3>The Legacy of the Saavedra Incident</h3>
      
      <p>Historians already call it one of the worst man-made disasters in American history. Comparisons to the Dust Bowl and Chernobyl abound. Millions remain displaced while industries may take generations to recover. The cleanup effort, projected at $1.5 to $2 trillion, will strain federal capacity for decades.</p>

      <p>And yet, some see in the tragedy an opportunity for transformation. Advocates argue that the moment could catalyze a wholesale reimagining of American infrastructure, energy, and labor policy. "This isn't just about removing a president," said Senator Alvin Turner (S–NM). "This is about ending an era of reckless deregulation. The people demand accountability, and they will have it."</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <p>As President Saavedra prepares for trial, the nation stands at a turning point. His impeachment is more than a judgment on one man — it is a referendum on an era defined by privatization, deregulation, and austerity. Whether he is removed or narrowly survives, the political order that created the Saavedra Incident has already begun to crumble. A new era, turbulent yet full of possibility, awaits.</p>
