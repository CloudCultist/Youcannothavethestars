      <p><strong>You Cannot Have the Stars</strong> is a speculative fiction novel that explores a world shaped by a radically different past and thrust into an unprecedented future.</p>

      <p>The story begins in a familiar yet fundamentally altered timeline, where the 20th century unfolded along a divergent path. In this alternate history, Eugene V. Debs was elected president in 1920, catalyzing a sweeping transformation of the United States into a global socialist power. Over the next century, the U.S. led advancements in medicine, environmental stewardship, worker rights, and technological development, becoming a beacon for post-capitalist societies across the planet.</p>

      <p>But by the 2030s, the world stands at a precipice. Political unrest simmers beneath utopian ideals. Emerging technologies — especially those connected to synthetic memory, neural integration, and global surveillance — have begun to blur the line between liberation and control. Meanwhile, scientists and governments grapple with discoveries that threaten the foundations of human identity, sovereignty, and survival.</p>

      <p>Then, contact is made.</p>

      <p><strong>You Cannot Have the Stars</strong> weaves together personal stories of eight central characters — politicians, scientists, engineers, survivors — as they navigate the aftermath of first contact with a highly advanced alien civilization. It is a story of power, trauma, trust, betrayal, and the dangerous price of hope.</p>
