    <p>It had been three months since the Ru-Lima broadcast, and Tabitha Bosanac was still adjusting to her new reality. The congresswoman who had once struggled to get her colleagues' attention now found herself at the center of the most significant political transformation in decades. Her presence in that White House bunker on April 10th had launched her from the back benches to the front pages, and the momentum showed no signs of slowing.</p>

    <p>After standing behind President Turner and Cosmonaut Komarov during their joint address regarding the broadcast, she knew she'd become a serious national figure, and she was right. The media had dubbed her "The Woman of the House," and polling showed her approval ratings climbing steadily. They had even begun to speculate she was a contender for the vice-presidential spot in the Blake campaign.</p>

    <p>Unknown to them all, Blake had already made his VP selection even before he had secured the nomination, and Tabitha hadn't even made the shortlist. He had chosen Secretary Adebayo, a decision that made perfect political sense even if it stung personally. The pairing balanced Blake's legislative gravitas with Adebayo's scientific credibility in an age where scientific expertise mattered more than it ever had. Tabitha had to admit, despite her disappointment, it was a wise choice.</p>

    <p>Then, when everything seemed to be settling into the familiar rhythms of campaign season, her world changed again.</p>

    <p>One typical Wednesday afternoon, she'd been sitting in her office with Sebastian Adebayo, continuing one of their weekly what-if sessions. This time, they were discussing post-contact scenarios, including potential scientific exchange, medical breakthroughs, and political fallout. These conversations had become a regular fixture in both their schedules, squeezed in between his campaign travel and her committee work. She found herself looking forward to them more than she expected. There was something about the way Sebastian's mind worked, how he could see three moves ahead while still caring about the human cost of each decision that drew her in. This was more proof that Blake's choice had been the right one.</p>

    <p>Today, Adebayo looked worn down but focused, the afternoon light streaming through her office windows catching the fatigue lines around his eyes. "Turner's worried that less cooperative nations might try to hoard whatever the Ru-Lima share with us: information, technology, gods know what else. We've got public commitments from the Soviets, China, the African Union, and even Brazil, to share everything we learn, but not everyone's playing ball."</p>

    <p>Tabitha nodded slowly, chewing the inside of her cheek. Of course, there would be outliers, nations that couldn't resist the temptation to keep alien knowledge for themselves, but she was surprised Brazil wasn't among them. They had been one of the leading nations in TIIBASA, the collection of anti-socialist states that had formed in the early sixties to counter the influence of the United States, Soviet Union, and China. Although TIIBASA had collapsed in the early nineties, the tension and distrust of the capitalist bloc still cast a long shadow over global affairs.</p>

    <p>Tabitha was about to respond when her MindBeam beeped softly. She looked down at the back of her hand and saw an incoming call from an unknown number. The green digits appeared faintly across her skin, glowing like a technological tattoo.</p>

    <p>Adebayo glanced down and noticed it too. He arched an eyebrow, curiosity replacing the weariness in his expression.</p>

    <p>Tabitha made a dismissive gesture, about to tell her MindBeam to ignore the call, when Adebayo tilted his head. "You're not going to answer?"</p>

    <p>"I usually don't take unlisted calls," she said, flexing her fingers as the digits pulsed gently.</p>

    <p>He offered a casual shrug, but his voice carried an edge she couldn't quite place. "Could be important. I can step out if you want privacy." He sounded oddly insistent, almost eager. After a few seconds of hesitation, Tabitha told her MindBeam to accept the call.</p>

    <p>... [CONTENT CONTINUES — full chapter text inserted here in <p> blocks, preserving paragraph breaks] ...</p>

    <p>The relief she felt was immediate, almost physical. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath until she exhaled. "Then, Jacob, let's do this."</p>
