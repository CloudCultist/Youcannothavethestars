    <h2>Alternate United States Timeline: 1940–1960</h2>
    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li><strong>November 5, 1940 –</strong> Democrat Cordell Hull is elected president, ending two decades of Socialist rule. As tensions escalate in Europe with the rise of Nazism, many Americans fear the Socialist Party would be too lenient due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and close U.S.-USSR ties. The Republican Party, having drifted rightward and appeared sympathetic to authoritarian regimes, fails to regain trust. Voters turn to the Democrats as a moderate alternative, cementing their role as the primary opposition. The Republicans gradually fade from national relevance.</li>
      <li><strong>Spring–Summer 1941 –</strong> Hull authorizes the Unified Defense Act, expanding the cooperative industrial base for defense production. U.S. diplomats warn Germany that an attack on the USSR could trigger American intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>December 7–10, 1941 –</strong> Japan attacks Pearl Harbor. The U.S. declares war the next day. On December 10, Germany invades the Soviet Union, prompting Hull to declare war on Germany and Italy, solidifying the U.S.-USSR alliance.</li>
      <li><strong>July 1942 –</strong> The American Labor Federation and cooperative industries sign the “Total Unity Compact,” agreeing to democratically managed but centrally directed wartime production. The mobilized hybrid economy balances state-owned sectors with union-led innovation, cementing the legitimacy of the Dual Economy Compromise.</li>
      <li><strong>January 1943 –</strong> At the Casablanca Conference, Hull, Churchill, and Stalin agree on “unconditional worker’s peace” as the Allied aim. U.S. troops land in North Africa while the Soviets break the siege of Stalingrad.</li>
      <li><strong>Fall 1943 –</strong> Italy collapses. New socialist republics emerge in southern France and northern Italy under Allied protection, establishing worker councils and cooperative farms as models of democratic socialist reconstruction.</li>
      <li><strong>June 6, 1944 –</strong> D-Day. Allied forces land in Normandy. Eisenhower, as Supreme Commander, bans the arrest of communist resistors and insists civilians be treated as future partners in liberation.</li>
      <li><strong>May–August 1945 –</strong> Germany surrenders. Hull refuses to use nuclear weapons against civilians, declaring that victory without “wholesale slaughter” proves democracy’s moral strength. The U.S. secretly retains nuclear weapons under presidential control, concealing their existence from allies and adversaries alike.</li>
      <li><strong>January 1946 –</strong> Japan surrenders after joint U.S.-Soviet operations. The Treaty of Copenhagen dissolves Germany into regional republics, while the Geneva Global Settlement Pact officially ends the war. The U.S., USSR, and Britain pledge mutual non-intervention and anti-fascist enforcement.</li>
      <li><strong>August 1946 –</strong> Socialist and Social Democratic governments sweep into power across Europe, while the Pacific Cooperative Republic is established in Japan with cooperative housing, public works, and industrial co-ops driving recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>April 1947 –</strong> The Copenhagen Accords establish the Pan-Economic Development Accord (PEDA), launching reconstruction focused on labor empowerment rather than imperial extraction. American engineers share cooperative expertise with European socialist republics.</li>
      <li><strong>June–October 1947 –</strong> The U.S. enters its first major peacetime boom since the Depression. Hull signs the National Housing and Transit Act, expanding cooperative housing and rural electrification.</li>
      <li><strong>February 1948 –</strong> The U.S. recognizes the People’s Free Republic of China, a broad leftist coalition, diverging from Moscow’s desire for a purely Communist state and straining U.S.-USSR relations.</li>
      <li><strong>November 2, 1948 –</strong> Dwight D. Eisenhower is elected president as a Democrat, defeating Socialist candidate Emma Gold in a landslide on promises of peace, internationalism, and “the dignity of labor.”</li>
      <li><strong>March 1949 –</strong> Eisenhower establishes the North Atlantic Cooperative Compact (NACC) with European socialist democracies. The USSR refuses to join, forming the Continental Defense Sphere.</li>
      <li><strong>October 1949 –</strong> U.S. occupation forces leave Japan as the Pacific Cooperative Republic holds its first democratic elections.</li>
      <li><strong>January–October 1950 –</strong> The Korean Crisis erupts as monarchist forces backed by non-socialist states briefly seize Seoul. Eisenhower deploys peacekeepers and blockade measures instead of conventional war. The Seoul Settlement establishes a unified socialist Korea, inspiring similar cooperative initiatives in Southeast Asia.</li>
      <li><strong>April–September 1951 –</strong> The First Global Labor Census, organized by the League of Nations Labor Organization, ranks the U.S. first in worker satisfaction. Eisenhower’s Universal Health Access Act creates a comprehensive cooperative healthcare system. The census becomes an annual tradition, standardizing labor practices worldwide.</li>
      <li><strong>Early 1952 –</strong> Congressional hearings expose wartime surveillance abuses. Public outrage sparks a privacy movement.</li>
      <li><strong>April 5, 1952 –</strong> FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover opposes privacy reforms in a Chicago Tribune op-ed, warning against “shielding danger.”</li>
      <li><strong>November 4, 1952 –</strong> Eisenhower is reelected. Congress passes the Privacy Rights Amendment (22nd Amendment), establishing constitutional protections against surveillance abuses.</li>
      <li><strong>March 1953 –</strong> Joseph Stalin dies. Reformist Soviet leaders experiment with regional worker councils, cautiously decentralizing governance.</li>
      <li><strong>August 12, 1953 –</strong> Eisenhower signs the 30-Hour Work Week Act and the Green Modernization Act, advancing work-life reform and renewable energy. Cooperative solar trams and worker-managed urban parks debut in Chicago and San Francisco.</li>
      <li><strong>May 1954 –</strong> The Supreme Court rules in Ellis v. Louisiana, banning racial segregation in all cooperative institutions. Eisenhower funds a Civil Equity Transition Corps to ensure compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>October 1954 –</strong> The Geneva Compact on Decolonization grants independence referendums across Africa and Asia. Cooperative oversight boards supervise fair elections and labor-based constitutions.</li>
      <li><strong>June 1955 –</strong> Eisenhower visits Berlin and delivers his “Peace is Labor” speech, declaring: “We do not fear socialism. We fear only the return of tyrants who forget the face of the worker.”</li>
      <li><strong>August 6, 1955 –</strong> Edward R. Murrow exposes America’s secret WWII nuclear weapons program in “The Secret That Saved the World.” He reveals Hull chose not to use the bomb in 1945, sparking fierce public debate about morality and nuclear oversight.</li>
      <li><strong>November 1956 –</strong> Socialist Henry Wallace wins the presidency, benefiting from voter disillusionment with Democratic dominance and rekindling support for cooperative economics.</li>
      <li><strong>1957–1958 –</strong> Wallace focuses on cooperative governance and technological collaboration with the reformed USSR, including joint Antarctic research stations and the launch of the Red-White Star I satellite in 1958.</li>
      <li><strong>1959–1960 –</strong> Early U.S.-USSR scientific collaboration expands into the Red-White Star space program, generating immense public excitement and laying the foundation for a cooperative technological revolution.</li>

    <p>
      Between 1940 and 1960, the United States navigated global war, postwar reconstruction, civil rights advances, and cooperative international leadership. The balance between democratic socialism and cooperative democracy transformed America into both a domestic model of labor-driven prosperity and a global leader in peace and scientific collaboration.
