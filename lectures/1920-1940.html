        <p>Good morning, everyone.</p>

        <p>Today, we're going to examine one of the most studied and debated eras in modern American history: the Socialist Era of 1920 to 1940. It’s important to remember that while you and I live in a world where cooperative structures, universal healthcare, and worker-ownership are the norm, this wasn’t always the case.</p>

        <h2>The Election of 1920</h2>
        <p>We begin in 1920, a year that changed the direction of American history forever. It started in relative political chaos. The Democrats, in an act of desperation or perhaps denial, nominated Woodrow Wilson for a third term, despite his debilitating stroke the year prior. His condition was concealed from the public, a decision that would backfire catastrophically.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the Republicans found themselves paralyzed by internal divisions. Their convention collapsed in deadlock, with neither General Leonard Wood nor Governor Frank Lowden securing the nomination. Instead of resolving the issue within party halls, they took their campaigns directly to the public. This move fractured the party further, leaving room for a new force to emerge.</p>

        <p>That force came from the Socialist Party, long marginalized in national politics. Eugene V. Debs, running from a federal prison cell under the Espionage Act, took advantage of the moment. He captured the growing disillusionment of workers, returning World War One veterans, and, critically, women, who were voting in a presidential election for the first time.</p>

        <p>When news of Wilson’s condition broke in October, it shattered the illusion of Democratic leadership. Disaffected voters from both parties turned to Debs. On November 2, 1920, Eugene Debs was elected President of the United States. His vice president, Seymour Stedman, would become just as pivotal in the years to come.</p>

        <h2>The Foundations of the Socialist State (1921–1924)</h2>
        <p>President Debs began his term while still imprisoned. His first acts, pardoning himself and other political prisoners, set the tone for a bold, unapologetic administration. He immediately pursued sweeping labor reforms. Though met with fierce resistance from conservative elements in Congress, he managed to pass the Public Works Labor Act in 1922, guaranteeing living wages and healthcare benefits for federal infrastructure workers.</p>

        <p>But Debs’ vision extended beyond domestic policy. In 1921, he began advocating for U.S. entry into the League of Nations, not as a capitalist empire, but as a partner in global labor solidarity. His vision of anti-imperial internationalism challenged traditional American foreign policy. While immediate entry was blocked, the seeds of international socialism had been sown.</p>

        <p>By 1923, Debs’ message had galvanized millions, but it had also created dangerous enemies. That year, he was assassinated by Charles Farnsworth, a radicalized businessman and former steel magnate. The assassination triggered the largest wave of labor strikes in American history. Over 5 million workers took to the streets. Federal investigators soon uncovered the “Businessman’s Plot," a conspiracy by industrial leaders to topple the Socialist government.</p>

        <p>This event, ironically, unified the nation. Public outrage at the capitalist sabotage attempt brought many centrists into the Socialist fold. Seymour Stedman assumed the presidency and pushed forward with Debs' vision.</p>

        <h2>Financial and Institutional Overhaul (1924–1930)</h2>
        <p>Stedman’s administration took aggressive steps to dismantle capitalist structures. The American Cooperative Bank Act in 1924 shifted financial power to worker-owned credit unions and cooperative banking institutions. The Federal Reserve was replaced by the People’s Bank in 1925, marking one of the most radical reorganizations of a national financial system in world history.</p>

        <p>Alongside these institutional reforms, the launch of Public Radio One brought free, union-sponsored educational content into millions of homes. The radio became both a symbol and a tool of socialist governance, an early version of state-directed but democratically managed media.</p>

        <p>Under Stedman, the United States also formally joined the League of Nations, with the goal of spreading cooperative economic systems and defending anti-colonial movements around the globe. While often described as a “peaceful revolution,” this era’s changes faced resistance, not only from former elites but also from ordinary citizens wary of rapid transformation.</p>

        <h2>The Short Depression and International Ascendancy (1927–1932)</h2>
        <p>Despite robust planning, the socialist economy was not immune to external shocks. In 1927, a “Short Depression” struck due to global commodity collapses and overexpansion of nationalized industries. But unlike the Great Depression that would soon devastate capitalist economies, the U.S. responded swiftly. The National Labor Corps was expanded to over 400,000 workers, modernizing infrastructure, improving literacy, and connecting rural communities to urban centers.</p>

        <p>In 1928, the League of Nations relocated its headquarters from Geneva to New York City. This symbolic move positioned the United States as the epicenter of global socialism and diplomacy.</p>

        <p>By 1929, when the global capitalist stock market crash occurred, the United States was shielded by its partially nationalized financial system. The National Recovery Securities Act placed critical industries such as transportation, utilities, and mining under joint public-worker ownership. Instead of economic collapse, the U.S. experienced only a mild recession and quick recovery.</p>

        <p>Importantly, this was not a command economy in the Soviet model. American socialism remained pluralistic, cooperative, and democratic. The profit motive wasn’t eliminated, but redirected toward collective needs.</p>

        <h2>Consolidation of the Socialist Consensus (1930–1936)</h2>
        <p>In the early 1930s, the United States took on a leadership role in hemispheric socialism. At the 1930 Pan-American Peace Conference, the U.S. spearheaded the Western Hemisphere Workers' Accord, standardizing labor rights across 14 nations.</p>

        <p>Domestically, the American Railways Federation consolidated all rail infrastructure under national control. It cut fares and doubled ridership in three years, serving as a model for sustainable, worker-directed public utilities.</p>

        <p>Racial justice also moved to the forefront. In 1932, Black labor leaders founded the National Negro Congress, backed by the Socialist Party. The organization’s dual focus on civil rights and labor solidarity helped bring racial equity into mainstream politics.</p>

        <p>In 1934, the Rural Access and Electrification Act expanded telephony, power grids, and high-speed rail to underserved areas, narrowing the urban-rural economic gap. That same year, the California General Strike brought full unionization to the agricultural sector.</p>

        <p>By this point, the Socialist Party was no longer just a rising force—it was the government. And yet, the movement remained dynamic. New leadership emerged with Norman Thomas, a Christian pacifist and disability rights advocate, who won the 1936 election.</p>

        <h2>Civil Rights, Disability, and Internationalism (1936–1940)</h2>
        <p>Thomas's administration prioritized accessibility and inclusion. The federal government implemented workplace accommodations, inclusive education programs, and architectural reforms to support people with disabilities.</p>

        <p>His foreign policy was uncompromisingly anti-fascist. In 1937, the United States imposed a comprehensive embargo on Francoist Spain, offering aid instead to the Republican forces. This represented a major evolution from Debs' pacifism toward an assertive defense of democratic socialism abroad.</p>

        <p>Domestically, the People’s Protection Act of 1938 criminalized lynching and racially motivated mob violence, finally codifying federal protections that civil rights activists had demanded for decades.</p>

        <p>As World War II began in 1939, the United States remained officially neutral. However, Thomas authorized massive material support for both the Soviet Union and the Allied democracies. The socialist state refused to take a back seat in the fight against fascism.</p>

        <p>Historians often refer to this era as “Red Internationalism,” where America used its industrial strength, moral vision, and global influence to shape a new geopolitical order.</p>

        <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <p>So, what do we make of the Socialist Era?</p>

        <p>It is not a simple story of idealism triumphant. It is a story of political fractures, assassinations, resistance from entrenched elites, and global pressures. It’s also a story of creative adaptation, how a grassroots movement, often excluded from power, used the tools of democracy to permanently reshape American society.</p>

        <p>We must not forget the international impact. American socialism emboldened labor movements across the globe and directly contributed to the global decline of colonialism in the mid-20th century.</p>

        <p>Some scholars argue that the U.S. model of “pluralistic socialism” inspired dozens of post-war states to adopt cooperative hybrid economies, neither purely capitalist nor centralized command systems. This system helped avoid the extremes seen in other revolutionary societies and created enduring institutions like the People’s Bank, Public Radio One, and the National Labor Corps.</p>

        <p>As we move forward in this course, I want you to think critically about the long legacy of this era. Not just what it accomplished, but what it left unresolved: racial inequities, power imbalances within cooperatives, and tensions between pacifism and interventionism.</p>
