                <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
            </header>

            <p>Agent Danielle Harper had been living a lie for two and a half years, and the weight of that deception pressed against her chest like a physical thing as she sat in the sterile breakroom of a Rio de Janeiro laboratory. To everyone around her, she was Dr. Brooklyn Decker, a disillusioned American biochemist who had found her way to Brazil through a combination of professional disappointment and growing anti-Western sentiment. It was a carefully constructed identity, complete with verifiable credentials and a psychological profile that made her exactly the kind of recruit a covert bioweapons project would want.</p>

            <p>The International Intelligence Agency had sent her here in late 2029 after Langley caught wind of something troubling: a rogue group of scientists working to create a highly infectious virus, funded by what intelligence suggested were ultra-wealthy Saudis. The vaccine was being developed alongside the weapon, of course, but that didn't make the project any less dangerous. Someone with the resources to buy a weaponized plague and its antidote wasn't planning to use either for humanitarian purposes.</p>

            <p>Since arriving in Brazil, Danielle had embedded herself thoroughly in the operation. She'd befriended Dr. João Baptista dos Santos, the lead scientist, and slowly earned his trust through a carefully crafted arc of ideological conversion. She'd started with her pseudo-mild anti-Western sentiments, then gradually "allowed" herself to be radicalized until Santos believed her transformation was genuine. Once convinced of her loyalty to the cause, he brought her into the project as a full partner.</p>

            <p>From there, Danielle had played a dangerous game: extract intel, sabotage development when possible, all while keeping her cover intact. So far, it seemed to be working. The constant performance exhausted her, but she'd grown skilled at compartmentalizing the person she was from the person she needed to be.</p>

            <p>The other key player in the lab, Dr. Verônica Oliveira de Almeida, posed a different problem. Officially tasked with creating the vaccine while Santos and "Brooklyn Decker" created the virus, Verônica remained impossible to pin down. Her backstory was flawless. She had verifiable credentials, a sterling reputation, and a résumé seemingly handcrafted for the mission. Joao loved it but Dani found it to be too perfect. Danielle kept a close eye on her, but so far, Verônica had given no concrete reason for suspicion beyond her involvement in developing a potential bioweapon.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Danielle's best efforts to slow the project through careful sabotage weren't enough; development continued to progress. It was going slower than it should have been, but it wasn't halted. The realization gnawed at her daily. She wanted to do more but her handlers at Langley coordinated her every move: who to cultivate, who to ignore, what parts of the process to stall, what to assist. Sometimes, it felt like they monitored her every breath, like even her bowel movements were scheduled.</p>

            <p>Despite the progress and Langley's coordination, Danielle maintained her morale by focusing on the mission's importance. She had no significant other, no children, but she had parents and a younger brother back in the States. Whenever doubt crept in about the endless deception, she'd imagine them healthy, safe, and alive because she was doing this job. She was out here, along with others throughout the world, running interference on threats they'd never hear about. That knowledge made the sleepless nights and constant performance worthwhile, even when the weight of living a lie threatened to crush her.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

            <p>Danielle Harper stirred her coffee in the staff breakroom, her spoon clinking against ceramic as cream and sugar swirled into the dark liquid. From the hallway came Dr. João Santos's voice, sharp and impatient, barking orders to some junior aide about sterile transfer protocols. She sighed. A typical morning in the lab, fluorescent lights humming overhead with their familiar mechanical drone.</p>

            <p>The coffee had finally cooled enough to drink. It wasn't bad, but they were out of her preferred creamer again, the powdered substitute unable to give it the consistency she liked. Still, she needed the caffeine after a sleepless night spent watching the ceiling fan spin above her bed, mind cycling through the data she'd already sent to Langley. For months now, she'd been carefully sabotaging their work: corrupted sequences, off-target vectors, tiny nudges meant to gum up progress without leaving traces.</p>

            <p>And it wasn't working.</p>

            <p>The morning before, Dr. Verônica Almeida had practically danced into the lab, voice bright with triumph. "Breakthrough!" she'd declared, glowing with pride. She'd been helping João in her spare time and had apparently pieced together something he'd missed. João, clearly trying not to grab onto false hope, had pored over her calculations and proclaimed them promising. Danielle had smiled and nodded in character, eyes fixed on the screen while her stomach tightened with each word of praise Verônica received. First chance she got, she'd slipped away to the breakroom, poured coffee, and tried not to panic.</p>

            <p>Her latest intel drop, hidden on a clunky flash drive and left at a predetermined dead drop, had included more than research. This time, she'd begged Langley to review her sabotage protocols and send additional guidance. Something, anything, to help her derail the project without exposing her cover.</p>

            <p>The response had come that morning, just three lines, each more demoralizing than the last: Maintain cover. Monitor progress. No deviation from objective.</p>

            <p>She took a deep breath and tried not to think about how close they were getting. At this rate, less than a year until João could make good on his promises to his financiers. She hadn't signed up to actually help create a deadly virus. She'd signed up to protect her family, her country, the entire world, and it felt like she was failing.</p>

            <p>She was still thinking about yesterday's events when the breakroom door opened and Verônica strolled in, posture relaxed, movements fluid. "Good morning again, Brook," she said with a polite nod. "You haven't been back to the lab this morning." An aide, probably the one João had been yelling at, hurried past the doorway, gaze locked on linoleum, clearly fleeing.</p>

            <p>"I'm tired as hell," Danielle replied, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. "Didn't sleep much last night."</p>

            <p>"Something on your mind?"</p>

            <p>"Nothing more than usual. I just need a few days off, I think."</p>

            <p>Verônica narrowed her eyes, studying Danielle's face with the intensity of someone trained to read people. "Then take them. We both know we don't need to ask." She poured herself coffee, the dark liquid steaming as it hit ceramic.</p>

            <p>"I know. I'll probably need to." Dani murmured. "I just..." A soft beep interrupted her, an alert from her MindBeam. She looked down to see the back of her hand lighting up with bright green numbers ticking down in steady progression. "What the hell?"</p>

            <p>Verônica, who didn't have a MindBeam, stared at the countdown on Dani's hand, too. "What is this about?" There was clear concern in her voice.</p>

            <p>The women exchanged a look, equal parts confusion and unease. From across the room, a small speaker in the corner crackled to life, connected via Wi-Fi to some unseen device upstairs. A robotic voice filled the breakroom, emotionless and mechanical: "Fifty-nine minutes, thirty-six seconds. Fifty-nine minutes, thirty-five seconds. Fifty-nine minutes, thirty-four seconds."</p>

            <p>Dani and Verônica set their cups down with sharp clicks against the countertop and headed toward the main lab. Their footsteps echoed in the hallway, usually bustling with activity but now strangely quiet. João was already there, seated at a terminal, eyes locked on the monitor displaying the same countdown. He turned as they entered, his usual confident demeanor replaced by visible worry.</p>

            <p>"What is this?" he asked, gesturing first at the screen, then to his temple. "I can hear it through my MindBeam too."</p>

            <p>"It seems to be playing everywhere," Verônica said, voice barely above a whisper.</p>

            <p>João looked at their hands, saw the green numbers there, and held up his own. The same countdown glowed against his dark skin. "Maybe we should evacuate the building," he said, concern bleeding into his voice. "Help me grab as many samples as possible, in case this is an attack."</p>

            <p>"If someone were going to attack the lab," Danielle said, "why would they announce it first?" Her logic made sense, but she couldn't shake the doubt curling in her chest. The IIA had protocols: killing and long-term harm were last resorts, avoided whenever possible. Maybe this was a warning, a chance to evacuate before a drone strike or lab fire.</p>

            <p>"I don't know, Dr. Decker, but help me, please. Make as many copies as you can while Verônica and I get the samples."</p>

            <p>Neither woman moved immediately, both transfixed by the countdown on screen.</p>

            <p>"Now, women," he barked at them. "Go!" He clapped his hands sharply as if they were disobedient school children.</p>

            <p>Dani bristled at the treatment but obeyed while Verônica bolted, heels clicking against polished floor as she ran toward her lab. Dani rushed to a nearby workstation and began transferring files to her MindBeam. Her fingers flew across the keyboard in a blur of motion, confident and precise. Simultaneously, she opened a secure link to Langley, using the connection as cover to offload a massive trove of intel. She knew she'd never get another chance like this. Under normal circumstances, João's paranoia would never allow personal devices to store lab data, but urgency had stripped away protocol, and Dani took full advantage. Once the information was uploaded to her MindBeam, no one could track what she did with it.</p>

            <p>The task took twenty minutes. With thirty-four minutes left in the countdown, they abandoned the lab with all the samples and data they could carry. Outside, the parking lot was deserted, all other scientists, aides, and support staff having already fled. The warm Brazilian air felt thick with humidity and tension.</p>

            <p>João turned to them, wiping sweat from his forehead. "You should come to my house. Whatever this is, we can wait it out there. I'm only ten minutes away." They nodded without argument. Dani climbed into her car and followed, hands gripping the steering wheel tighter than necessary.</p>

            <p>As Dani drove, she noticed the roads through Rio were strangely quiet. The usual traffic chaos had been replaced by eerie calm. She switched on her satellite radio and flipped through stations, surprised that everyone was off the air. All she could hear was that same mechanical voice, now counting down in Portuguese.</p>

            <p>"Trinta e um minutos, vinte segundos. Trinta e um minutos, dezenove segundos."</p>

            <p>A shiver ran down her spine and she shut it off, preferring silence to that emotionless countdown.</p>

            <p>When they arrived at João's home, Danielle blinked in disbelief. Sleek, contemporary Brazilian architecture: smooth stucco walls painted in soft pastels, wide glass windows reflecting afternoon sun, gently sloped red-tiled roof. The lawn looked hand-landscaped, every palm tree and flowering bush perfectly positioned.</p>

            <p>Verônica apparently shared her reaction. She slapped João on the back with a laugh that didn't quite mask her surprise. "Someone got an advance on the project."</p>

            <p>"Don't you live alone?" Dani asked, taking in the property's size.</p>

            <p>"Mostly." João flashed a grin. "But I have no trouble finding company for the night." Dani shook her head and rolled her eyes, making a show so João would see. He winked in response.</p>

            <p>As they followed João up the walkway, they watched him press his thumb to a biometric reader beside the door. The device beeped softly, the door unlocked and swung open by itself. Inside, the house was even more lavish. A massive flat-screen television mounted on the wall flickered on, probably connected to his MindBeam. Like the monitors at the lab, this one displayed the same green countdown, numbers stark against black screen.</p>

            <p>"Come, let's go to my sala de visitas," he said, strolling toward the back of the house with the casual confidence of someone showing off his wealth. Danielle followed, ignoring the impressive architecture and expensive furnishings. This was no time for awe. Before reaching the sala, João had them stop and put the samples in a small, refrigerated storage container in his office. There were other vials already inside, but Dani didn't know what they were. Once they were placed inside, João carefully closed the door and led them out.</p>

            <p>Once they arrived in João's overdecorated living room, he collapsed onto a plush leather couch that clashed with the modern white and chrome aesthetic, rich brown leather completely out of place. An ornate coffee table sat in the middle of the room, science magazines decorating its surface. Dani leaned over and grabbed one. Brazilian, written in Portuguese, but it was the person on the cover that drew her eye.</p>

            <p>More than a year ago, she'd found out Secretary of Science and Technology Sebastian Adebayo had been asking about her. She'd forgotten about it, but seeing his face on the magazine made her wonder why again. He'd been insistent too, first approaching Secretary Parsons after a cabinet meeting. Since Parsons, as Secretary of Domestic Security, oversaw the International Intelligence Agency, he was technically her boss. Parsons hadn't known who Danielle Harper was at first, but when he found out, he told Adebayo to mind his own business. The DST Secretary didn't need access to classified intelligence assets.</p>

            <p>Adebayo hadn't dropped it. He'd gone over Parsons's head to the President. Turner had reviewed the request, looked into Danielle Harper, and echoed Parsons: mind your business. As far as she knew, that had been the end of it. She took one more look at the magazine cover and dropped it back on the table.</p>

            <p>From the couch, João pressed his temple, activating his MindBeam. The television flickered on. As expected, the countdown was on this screen too, ticking down with relentless precision.</p>

            <p>"Well," he said, crossing his legs and settling into the cushions, "it seems I was perhaps premature making copies of everything and bringing the samples home. Unless my home is going to be attacked as well as the radio stations, I assume this is probably nationwide, maybe even international."</p>

            <p>"Who would even have this capability?" Verônica asked. The question echoed one that had haunted Danielle the entire drive, a cold knot of dread growing in her stomach.</p>

            <p>"Brooklyn here is American," João said, gesturing toward her. "Would they be able or willing to do something like this?"</p>

            <p>"I have no idea," Dani replied truthfully. "Telecommunications and hacking aren't my area. I couldn't tell you if we'd be capable, much less if we would." Even if she asked Langley, she doubted they'd answer. The agency specialized in keeping agents in the dark about operations outside their immediate scope.</p>

            <p>After a few minutes, João got up and walked to the bar in the corner. The polished wood surface held an impressive collection of bottles, labels catching light from the window. He grabbed a bottle of cachaça and lifted it triumphantly. "To mark this curious occasion, how about something special?" He grabbed three glasses from beneath the bar. "This isn't the cheap stuff, aged five years, straight from a boutique distillery in Minas. We'll make caipirinhas the right way."</p>

            <p>After preparing the drinks with an exaggerated flourish, muddling lime and sugar with obvious expertise, João handed them each a glass garnished with a flamboyant slice of star fruit and sparkly cocktail pick. Verônica looked down and rolled her eyes, making Dani wonder what exactly she found ridiculous.</p>

            <p>When João finished making his own drink, he sat on the expensive but mismatched couch. He sipped, glancing at his two colleagues when he thought they wouldn't notice. Dani did, of course; it was her job to notice. She glanced at Verônica, who appeared calm, either unaware or pretending not to care about their host's wandering gaze.</p>

            <p>As the countdown reached its final seconds, Dani's grip on her glass tightened. For a moment, she thought she might crush it, crystal warming under the pressure of her fingers. She looked at her two coworkers, seeing they both looked exactly how she felt: tense, expectant, afraid.</p>

            <p>Finally, after what seemed like forever, the numbers blinked out and an image of Earth appeared, rotating gently, silent and vast. Danielle could only stare, breath caught in her throat as she watched their world spin in the darkness of space.</p>

            <p>Then came the voices, talking about life beyond Earth. The camera pulled back through the solar system, past known planets, before a fifth gas planet came into view and disappeared in a flash. Verônica leaned forward but said nothing. Finally, the view stopped once the entire galaxy filled the screen with orange stars scattered across spiral arms.</p>

            <p>And then the being appeared. It started to speak though its mouth didn't move. "My name is Tru-Urth, and I am from a species that calls itself the Ru-Lima."</p>

            <p>Danielle stared at the screen, mind racing through implications. If this was real, every assumption about everything from national security to every individual threat facing humanity had just changed. The bioweapon she'd been trying to stop might be meaningless compared to whatever came next. She found herself thinking about the intel she'd just uploaded to Langley. Whatever the agency had known or suspected, they hadn't warned her about this. Either they were as surprised as everyone else, or she'd never even come close to understanding the full picture.</p>

            <p>The alien continued speaking about peaceful contact, about species helping each other across thousands of years. Danielle wondered if humanity could manage that when she couldn't even trust her own agency, when she spent her days lying to prevent a weapon that might not matter anymore.</p>

            <p>When the broadcast ended, they sat in silence. Finally, she excused herself to the bathroom. João pointed her in the right direction, and she activated her MindBeam to check if the intel dump she'd sent to Langley had gone through. It had, which might or might not be good. The IIA had told agents never to use MindBeams to connect to headquarters, despite the fact they couldn't be tracked. With technology advancing daily, there was no telling when formerly secure connections could reveal an agent's identity.</p>

            <p>After spending longer than she should have in the bathroom, she finally emerged, ignoring Verônica and João discussing the countdown and alien announcement. She told them she was leaving. João waved, Verônica said goodbye. Without smiling, Dani walked down the stairs and out the front door to her vehicle.</p>
