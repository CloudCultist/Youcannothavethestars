            <p>It wasn't often that Tabitha wondered what time it was while she worked; that was a dangerous habit she avoided at all cost. If she was spending her time wondering about anything, even the time, that meant her focus was drifting, and unfocused attention inevitably led to dropped productivity, which was unforgivable. As she'd been trained, she scolded herself for not giving her job 100%. If her attention wasn't locked on her job, that was one step away from stealing from her company. She'd already been written up once for letting her productivity slip to ninety-six percent, sat through the mandatory video course on how "important and fulfilling" work was for every citizen of the United States, then stayed the required two unpaid hours to compensate for her failure.</p>

            <p>As usual, she tried not to think about her surroundings, about the tiny, airless box that passed for her workstation, about the conveyor belt that rattled past her station like mechanical breathing, delivering its parade of identical components before whisking them away to Timothy Hall's station. And certainly not about the soul-crushing - no, the joyful, she reminded herself - task of pressing the one-inch processor chip onto each piece of waiting hardware before it slid onward.</p>

            <p>For twelve hours a day, six days a week, this was her entire world: white walls close enough to touch, the endless conveyor belt, hardware, chip, next, over and over. The cycle was so absolute she could feel her own thoughts being stamped out, piece by piece, like defective units quietly discarded down the line. She started to glance toward the ceiling but caught herself. Missing even one piece would drop her numbers again, and Tim would report her at shift's end, just as she would report Elizabeth Serrano upstream if Elizabeth's work fell below standard. In truth, they all knew the reports were unnecessary. Like Tabitha's station, Elizabeth's was ringed with a dozen ceiling-mounted cameras, each with its blank black lens focused on them at all time, always watching.</p>

            <p>Management had a duty to protect the company from slacking employees or "loss of labor efficiency," as the training modules so succinctly put it. Employees had to earn their paycheck. Nothing came free.</p>

            <p>For several minutes, Tabitha forced her mind back to her task, but the reprieve didn't last very long. Soon she was thinking about her legs and her back, an ache that she was only too familiar with, the one that came from standing hour after hour on concrete floors. She had barely enough time to push the thought out of her mind, however, when a sharp electronic beep cut through the air, which was the warning that she was slowing down. She sighed. A few more seconds and her rate would slip below target, bringing her closer to another write-up. She straightened, rolled her shoulders until they cracked, and returned to fitting chips</p>

            <hr>

            <p>At 1700, the conveyor belt shuddered to a stop, and Tabitha's shoulders loosened. Another workday was done and she was free to go home, though her bladder reminded her she'd skipped using the restroom during her second unpaid five-minute break. That was a decision she now regretted.</p>

            <p>When she stepped away from her station, the door's automatic lock clicked open behind her. Her apron came off in one practiced motion, and she hung it on the wall hook to her right. As she stepped back, she noticed the fabric thinning along the seams and reminded herself to bring twenty dollars for a replacement on Monday. It wouldn't do to be caught in worn gear during a surprise inspection, technically a fireable offense, though she hadn't heard of anyone actually losing their job for it.</p>

            <p>The corridor toward the warehouse's front was narrow, lined with gray composite walls under overhead lighting that cast a perpetual midday glare. She glanced down the hall and smiled at the sight of Abigail Barrett, her best friend, already waving. They met halfway, and she passed Timothy Hall along the way. She gave him a small nod and received the faintest curve of his lips in return.</p>

            <p>Tabitha allowed herself a flicker of warmth. She harbored a mild crush on Tim, though he looked about ten years younger and they'd spoken only a handful of times. Company policy strictly forbade personal interaction between male and female employees, deeming it a "productivity risk." Even talking to an opposite-sex coworker outside work could be grounds for termination, a rule most corporations shared. The rationale was simple: relationships led to complications, and complications slowed the line. At the thought of being fired, Tabitha banished Tim from her mind. Instead, she focused her attention back on Abigail and they met with a quick fist bump and continued toward the front.</p>

            <p>"What's up, Abigail?" Tabitha asked her friend.</p>

            <p>"Not much, Tabitha. I'm really just glad it's Saturday. Just gonna go home, relax and then sleep in tomorrow before we're back here on Monday."</p>

            <p>Tabitha chuckled. "That's about what my plan is, too. I love my job, you know, and the pay and benefits are amazing - " she was purposely talking slightly louder than necessary for the corridor cameras – "but I enjoy my day off, too."</p>

            <p>As the two women walked into the warehouse locker room, they split to their assigned spaces. Tabitha walked the short distance to hers and then unlocked her compartment, gathered her things, and slammed the door shut as Abigail closed hers. She excused herself for the restroom and jogged toward the women's door. She pulled out two crisp one-dollar bills and then fed them into the wall-mounted slot. The reader accepted her payment and unlocked the door, her fee for water usage. She finished quickly, skipped the fifty-cent soap, and wiped her damp hands on her pants, saving another dollar by avoiding paper towels.</p>

            <p>When she emerged, Abigail was waiting. Together they made their way to the warehouse front. They lived in the same building as the factory, which was a common arrangement in the metroplex. To reach their apartments, they'd walk the length of the main thoroughfare, step onto the outer platform, and descend six flights to the residential tier.</p>

            <p>At the exterior doors, they reached for their umbrellas. The tops gleamed with mirrored finishes that flared painfully in the sunlight until they stepped beneath the protective black interiors, shielding them from lingering harmful rays. Tabitha noticed a bent section in Abigail's umbrella frame and nodded toward it.</p>

            <p>"You might want to fix that," she said.</p>

            <p>Abigail followed her gaze and sighed. "Damn. That's just one more expense I don't need. Everything's way too expensive nowadays." She trailed off, glancing at Tabitha, who cocked her head in surprise. No one talked like that since all prices were set at fair market value. Everyone knew corporations could charge far more but chose not to out of goodwill. When Abigail realized what she'd said, she quickly added, "I mean, I've got the money. I'll just get a new one tomorrow." She forced a half-smile and started walking.</p>

            <p>At the platform's edge, Tabitha and Abigail paused and looked up, just like they always did. Far above, the Orchid Corporation building climbed into the hazy sky, tier after tier of wealth. Tabitha wished, as she always did, that she was going up instead of down.</p>

            <p>In the city's vertical order, wealth determined altitude. The richest lived at the highest levels while the poorest lived at the lowest. The middle floors housed company operations - factories, warehouses, headquarters. Above headquarters, the white-collar working class enjoyed fancy restaurants, gyms, parks, high-end shopping and more. Below, the blue-collar working class had public cafeterias, public showers, and bargain stores. Each building was a sealed ecosystem with its own internal currency, valid only within its walls. They also had in-house products cheaper when bought with company currency. Tabitha could theoretically buy competitor products, but she'd pay far more, and, if she was being honest, she wasn't sure she wouldn't be fired for it. Even though holding currency from other businesses or shopping at competing establishments wasn't illegal, many workers were terminated simply for being seen there.</p>

            <p>Tabitha lived in the Orchid Corporation building in New York City, the primary center of the SNY metroplex, a sprawl of skyscrapers stretching seventy-five miles in every direction. It was the single largest continuous urban area in the nation by population, with only the Houston-Galveston-Beaumont metroplex rivaling it.</p>

            <p>In New York City, like every other metroplex, most citizens lived in these towers. The rest, "the lazy," as company modules, newsfeeds, and school curriculum called them, clustered in shanties between buildings, living off scraps. As a child, Tabitha had tossed leftovers down to them for sport, laughing with friends as the ragged masses scrambled for food. She'd never forgotten their hands clawing at the air for morsels that rained from above.</p>

            <p>As the company reminded them, the poor always complained about needing "help," but Tabitha knew better than to view it that way. There were no free rides and hard work was the only path forward, and government wasn't there to coddle leeches.</p>

            <p>"Hey, Tabitha." Abigail's voice snapped her from her thoughts.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, what's up?"</p>

            <p>"I got my hands on a beta version of a new VR sim. It hasn't even been released to the public yet. It's pretty fun." She said this with measured nonchalance, like this was normal. It wasn't. You couldn't get something that hadn't been released. Tabitha frowned. If she couldn't go buy the sim herself, what was the point?</p>

            <p>"Okay, but if you can't buy it, how'd you get it?"</p>

            <p>Abigail hesitated and then looked to the edge of the platform as she said, "someone let me borrow it."</p>

            <p>Tabitha's heart skipped. "Borrowed it?" She hissed quietly, not wanting to draw attention. "What about the creator? They're losing profit because of you."</p>

            <p>"That's the thing," Abigail said, still staring at the stairs ahead. "They're not after profit. They just want people to play it. Really."</p>

            <p>Tabitha had been about to step down the first step but stopped, her foot resting on the edge. Someone behind her had to scoot around the two friends to reach the stairs, and Tabitha waited for them to descend out of earshot. She wanted an explanation but didn't want anyone to overhear the conversation and report them, especially since this was the third strange thing Abigail had said since leaving the factory.</p>

            <p>Abigail sighed and shook her head. "Never mind, forget I brought it up. I'll just give it back and try to pay them for playing it. You're right. They deserve the profit." She started walking down the steps and Tabitha followed close behind.</p>

            <p>When they reached the landing to story, Tabitha asked, "what's so fun about it?"</p>

            <p>Abigail perked up again and said, "well, it's so original and well-made, especially for an amateur. They really think outside the box."</p>

            <p>They walked the rest of the way down in silence. Once they reached their level, they walked toward the entrance, closing their umbrellas as they stepped into the corridor leading to their apartments. Abigail lived closer to the entrance and, as always, they stopped in front of her door. "Give me a second," she said, unlocking her door and stepping inside. Tabitha put one foot across the threshold to keep the door from sliding closed. The apartment, exactly like her own, was small but functional: same bed in the far left corner, same TV against the far wall, same armchair facing the TV, same kitchen area on the right. Everything Abigail needed for comfortable existence.</p>

            <p>Inside, Abigail walked to her VR unit beside the TV and pressed a button that released a small cube, which Tabitha figured was the sim she'd mentioned. She held it in her palm as she returned to the front door.</p>

            <p>"Here. Try it for a day. If you don't like it, give it back and I'll return it. If you do, you can pay the creator, and I'll pass it along. It would mean a lot to them if you played it. The creator really wants to hear what people think."</p>

            <p>Against her better judgment, Tabitha took the cube. She stepped back and held it up. "Fine. I'll try it, but it better be fun. This goes against everything I believe in, you know?"</p>

            <hr>

            <p>The game was ready.</p>

            <p>Tabitha's hands trembled, not just from excitement but from guilt. She'd borrowed the sim instead of paying for it, a small but highly unethical act. She forced herself not to think about the creator losing well-earned profit just by her possessing the game. Finally pushing the thought away, she settled into her worn armchair and reached for the jack resting on the table beside her. Her fingers found the familiar port at the back of her head, and with one last steadying breath, she plugged in. Almost instantly, every muscle stiffened, then dissolved into a wave of bliss washing over her entire body.</p>

            <p>When she opened her eyes, she found herself outside, though the word felt inadequate for whatever this was. Everything around her was alive with a green she had no name for, stretching across the land in soft, restless waves. Among the green stalks swaying in the wind were patches of smaller growths, bright splashes of color so vivid they seemed unreal, as if the world had been painted in these vibrant hues. When she turned, she saw hundreds of tall, narrow shapes rising together far above her head, their rough brown surfaces vanishing into dense shadow beyond. Each tall stump had wide heads of green waving in the breeze. The air carried a chorus of unfamiliar noises, gentle and strangely calming. She drew a breath, and the taste was sharp and pure, tinged with a scent that defied memory.</p>

            <p>VR had been part of Tabitha's life for as long as she could remember, and she was sure it had existed long before that. Every game she'd played carried a tell, a glitch or detail that broke the illusion, reminding her she was inside a simulation. But this VR was different, and Tabitha was afraid if she didn't keep reminding herself it was fake, she'd forget and stay there forever.</p>

            <p>Growing up, Tabitha had heard repeatedly how horrible life used to be before the post-scarcity society she lived in took hold, the dream of every generation, the pinnacle of human achievement. Every basic need was met, and then some, by wages a worker earned. The utopia she was lucky to inhabit was what everyone had long strived for, and Tabitha believed she had experienced all it offered.</p>

            <p>Now, everything had changed and she knew she had been very wrong. There was one thing she'd never experienced and that was she had never truly been outside. Sure, she had stood beyond the walls for the brief walks between floors in the Orchid Corp building where she lived and worked, but she'd never really stepped beyond its influence. Everything she needed existed within that giant, insulated complex. She was shielded from pollution, decay, and the toxic wasteland beyond. The Orchid Corp building was safe and comfortable, so comfortable, in fact, that Tabitha had never even considered the world outside. The outside might as well have been lifeless and barren; there was no temptation to experience it. She couldn't believe how wrong she was.</p>

            <p>Tabitha found herself walking through thick green foliage, breathing crisp air, listening to nature sounds long vanished from New York City for several minutes, keeping the line of the tall brown cylinders to her right. She kept glancing over to that area and refused to go inside. She couldn't see more than a couple dozen feet inside and that made her uncomfortable. After several minutes of walking, Tabitha found herself wondering: where was the fun? She promised herself a few more minutes, and if the excitement Abigail had mentioned didn't come, she would unjack and try another sim, or maybe just slip into the Relax program and unwind from the long day.</p>

            <p>Just as Tabitha was about to give up, a sound cut through the gentle chorus. Her implants had been feeding her the sources of every noise so far, birdcalls, a babbling brook, the faint rustle of leaves, but this was different. She stopped at the crunch of a footstep on dry debris.</p>

            <p>Tabitha turned sharply, but no one was behind her. "Hello?" she called, her voice carrying across the meadow. Only silence greeted her. She told herself it was nothing, just code playing tricks, but worry lingered. She heard it again and she pivoted toward the sound. "Hello? Is someone there?" She backed away from the forest that suddenly seemed even more large and threatening.</p>

            <p>"Hello," a voice said at last. After a pause, it continued. "What's your name?"</p>

            <p>From the thick foliage stepped a woman moving with natural, almost impossible grace. Long black hair spilled down her back and across an angular, elegant face with wide eyes, a small nose, full lips. She wore a light yellow sundress and a wide-brimmed white hat. Tabitha had never seen anyone so beautiful, though she couldn't tell if it was the woman herself or the unreal perfection of this place that made her feel that way.</p>

            <p>"My name's Tabitha," she said before she could stop herself.</p>

            <p>The woman's lips curved into a small smile. She glanced down, tucking hair behind one ear. "I'm Danielle Harper," she replied.</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded and then asked the woman, "who are you?"</p>

            <p>Danielle's eyes sparkled with something like pride. "I'm the creator of this virtual world." That didn't surprise Tabitha since lot's of creators put themselves in their VR's. However, they didn't make themselves so realistic. Danielle's VR was still unlike anything Tabitha had ever experienced. The creator, not realizing or not caring that Tabitha had started thinking about something else continued. She swept her arm wide, indicating the world around them. "Isn't this place beautiful?"</p>

            <p>"Yes," Tabitha admitted. "But this isn't like any world I've seen before. Where are we supposed to be?"</p>

            <p>"We're in a meadow at the edge of a vast forest," Danielle said. "I wanted to capture the beauty of Earth, how it was before climate change destroyed it."</p>

            <p>Tabitha frowned. "What's climate change, Danielle?"</p>

            <p>The woman tilted her head and said first, "please, call me Dani. That's the name I prefer." She then gave a brief, matter-of-fact explanation of climate change, but when she finished, Tabitha seemed not to have heard a word. She looked up from where her bare foot had been brushing the soft green grass.</p>

            <p>"I like the name Dani," she said, as if the explanation for the hostile climate outside the Orchid Corp building was of no interest.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Hours seemed to pass as they talked about anything and everything Tabitha could think of. Dani seemed interested in whatever Tabitha wanted to discuss.</p>

            <p>"Why are you barefoot?" Tabitha suddenly asked, looking down at Dani's feet. It had been bothering her for a while. "Maybe you should put your shoes back on."</p>

            <p>"No, I'm staying barefoot," Dani said. "I love the feeling of grass under my feet."</p>

            <p>Tabitha crouched and rubbed the green beneath her fingers. "Is this what you call grass? I've never seen it before."</p>

            <p>A flicker of sadness crossed Dani's face. "Your society really does keep you ignorant, doesn't it, Tabitha?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha bristled, feeling insulted. "I'll have you know I'm a product of the greatest system in human history."</p>

            <p>For reasons Tabitha couldn't understand, Dani laughed, not at Tabitha, but at something else she couldn't pinpoint. She didn't know if she should be insulted or not. Ignoring the laugh, Tabitha continued, "We have the best schools, the strongest industry, the greatest government, the finest rulers."</p>

            <p>"And what kind of government do you have?"</p>

            <p>"We live under pure, free-market capitalism."</p>

            <p>"And what's free-market capitalism?"</p>

            <p>"It's a system of government and economics. It stresses no taxes, no regulation, abundant private industry, and consumerism. It gives workers as much freedom of choice as possible."</p>

            <p>Tabitha didn't notice Dani's expression as she proudly recited lessons drilled into her at company school; school her parents had paid dearly for her to attend, lifting her above the lower classes crammed into the building's poorer floors.</p>

            <p>"Did you go to school, Tabitha?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha raised her head high, a smile plastered on her face. She was one of the lucky ones who could say yes. She launched into another monologue about school.</p>

            <p>Dani let Tabitha ramble for a few minutes and then interrupted. "If you don't know something as simple as grass, what did you learn at school?"</p>

            <p>There was no hint of irony in Tabitha's voice. "All the important things. Government, economics, history, basic math, reading, and writing. Everything that prepares us to be strong, productive, valuable members of society."</p>

            <p>Dani nodded. "And I assume your value is derived from your work?"</p>

            <p>"Yes," Tabitha answered.</p>

            <p>"How much do you work?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha smirked, shaking her head at the ignorance she assumed Dani had, though she never said it aloud. "We work a standard week, seventy-two hours over six days."</p>

            <p>"And are you happy, Tabitha?"</p>

            <p>"I am," Tabitha said confidently. "I have my stuff."</p>

            <p>Tabitha didn't notice Dani's frown. Shaking her head, she asked, "your stuff makes you happy?"</p>

            <p>Excitement lit up Tabitha's face. "It's the most rewarding feeling to consume. Not only do I have all the things I shouldn't live without, but the more stuff I have, the better I seem to others."</p>

            <p>"So your status is based on how much you own?"</p>

            <p>"Yes. Our status depends on what we have and what we can buy."</p>

            <p>"Tell me more. How do you choose your leaders?" Dani leaned down and plucked a blade of what she called grass, rolling it between her fingers.</p>

            <p>"We're capitalists. We get our leaders the way all capitalist countries do, the way the United States always has. We elect a president to four-year terms. Before election day, the 539 biggest corporations average their profits over the last four years, and the two highest earners put forward their CEOs as presidential candidates. We choose our leader from those two. The winner becomes president; the runner-up becomes vice president."</p>

            <p>"What about the other 537 CEOs?"</p>

            <p>"Well, the CEOs of the next 100 largest companies make up the Senate. The remaining 437 form the House of Representatives. They're apportioned by state GDP, from richest to poorest. The richest states get the top CEOs, and so on."</p>

            <p>Dani nodded knowingly. "I see. So first, the CEOs don't have to live in the state they represent?"</p>

            <p>"No," Tabitha said with a laugh. "That's just silly."</p>

            <p>Without reacting, Dani continued, "And second, the government exists to protect the wealthy and corporations?"</p>

            <p>"Exactly. What other function could government serve but to protect the rich? They provide jobs and wages to the rest of us. Without them, where would we be? To protect them is to protect all of us."</p>

            <p>"I don't see it as protection, and frankly, you don't sound very free," Dani said.</p>

            <p>The words made Tabitha's mouth fall open. "What? I'm free. The Constitution of the United States guarantees basic freedoms to all Americans."</p>

            <p>"You're free, Tabitha? Really? You truly believe that?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded firmly. "Of course I do. I can buy anything I can afford. That's more freedom than most people in history have ever had."</p>

            <p>Dani shook her head, looking Tabitha straight in the eye. "My dear Tabitha, that isn't freedom." She turned away and started walking.</p>

            <p>At first, Tabitha thought about ending the sim, ripping the jack from her temple and destroying the cube Abigail had given her. So far, this adventure had brought only confusion and doubt. There was no way it should fall into anyone else's hands. But against her better judgment, she followed. "Where are you going?"</p>

            <p>Without slowing, Dani replied, "There's a stream just inside the forest. I'm going to put my feet in the water. You can join me if you'd like."</p>

            <hr>

            <p>By the stream, Tabitha stepped into the cold, clear water, following Dani's lead. It felt just as good as the grass beneath her feet. Without thinking, she curled her toes, watching brown mud spread into the water, muddying it briefly before the current swept it away.</p>

            <p>"Tabitha, I need to tell you something. At birth, every baby has a chip implanted in their head, storing basic information like name, age, sex, race." She paused, waiting for Tabitha to respond, but Tabitha only stared, silent and expectant.</p>

            <p>"But you see, the chip doesn't just store your identity. It subtly influences your thinking. It's not full mind control, but it nudges you in certain directions. It manipulates parts of your brain with a reward and punishment system so when you think positively about the system, it floods your brain with feel-good hormones. When you think negatively, it triggers fear or depression. This way, you push yourself to think good thoughts about your job, company, and life, to feel good."</p>

            <p>Tabitha opened her mouth to say something, but Dani put up a finger to silence her. Tabitha, who had always been taught to obey her superiors, even when it seemed weird, closed her mouth immediately.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry. This is important." Dani said to her, eyes locked on Tabitha's. "But the chip isn't not perfect, so they added other features. It picks up signals from everything around you, like advertisements. When there's an ad nearby for something you'd want, it nudges you to turn toward it. Seeing the ad releases the same feel-good hormones, increasing your chances of buying the product."</p>

            <p>Tabitha didn't fully believe Dani, how could she? She had complete control of her own mind. Her feelings about work were her own, right? The things she bought were truly what she wanted, weren't they? "I don't believe you," she said simply.</p>

            <p>Dani stepped closer and took Tabitha's hands in hers. Tabitha tensed but didn't pull away.</p>

            <p>"It's true, Tabitha. However, when you joined this sim, the very first thing it did was turn the chip off. With it off, maybe now you can start thinking differently."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Dani took a step back and opened her mouth like she just had an idea. "Here. I want to show you something. It's far more powerful than anything I could tell you."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, the forest and stream vanished.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Tabitha Bosanac and Danielle Harper stood in the middle of a wide street. On either side, short, squat buildings lined the road in neat rows, stretching to cross streets at each end. Similar houses stood along those perpendicular roads as well.</p>

            <p>"This is a 1950s New York suburb," Dani explained. "These buildings are houses, and each one is home to a single family. Most have a living room, kitchen, two or three bedrooms, and a bathroom."</p>

            <p>Tabitha blinked in disbelief. She had never imagined it was possible for a family to live in their own house. Her entire life had been spent in cramped apartments, first with her mother, father, and sister in a small family unit, then in her own single-room apartment, even smaller. She had always thought of the family apartment as huge, but now even that felt claustrophobic compared to what she was seeing.</p>

            <p>Dani continued, "Over time, cities expanded, swallowing these suburban neighborhoods. Businesses grew larger, pushing urban areas to stretch for hundreds of miles. Some cities even merged, forming sprawling metropolises like the Houston-Galveston-Beaumont or Boston-Hartford-Providence areas. Outside these mega-cities are rural lands, mostly for food production, but even those areas are tightly controlled, just like the building you work in."</p>

            <p>They walked up a wide concrete path toward a parked car. On the right, a smaller path branched toward a front door. Dani led Tabitha inside. The house opened into a spacious living room with a couch, a side chair, two small tables holding lamps, a long rectangular table with a vase, and a television set against one wall.</p>

            <p>Without really stopping to study the dwelling, the two women began touring the place. As they moved through rooms, Dani named and described the use for each. There was the living room, or den, where the family would spend evenings together. There was a dining room with a sturdy wooden table and four chairs, alongside a glass-doored cabinet displaying fine plates, bowls, and cups. Nearby was something Dani called a radio, which allowed the family to listen to music, news, and sporting events. They passed through the kitchen and down a hallway to two bedrooms, the larger for parents, the smaller for a child.</p>

            <p>"All of this," Dani said, "was for one family. And each house on this street had a similar interior. Each home typically housed only one single family."</p>

            <p>Tabitha's eyes widened, her mind filled with shock and amazement. The sheer space was overwhelming, and she couldn't fathom why a family would need so many rooms. She had always thought her family's tiny apartment was large, but this was almost excess – luxury beyond imagining.</p>

            <p>After the tour, Dani took Tabitha outside again, showing her around the neighborhood. She stopped by a modest school building. "Kids went here every day for basic education, from age five or six until they were seventeen or eighteen."</p>

            <p>Tabitha frowned. "They went to school instead of work?"</p>

            <p>"Yes. It was mandatory. After finishing school, they could attend college or enter the workforce."</p>

            <p>Tabitha thought of her own world, where kids left school at eleven, apprenticed unpaid for five years, the time needed to become expert in their field. Then they'd move into full-time, paid work at sixteen, getting their own apartment. School until seventeen or eighteen seemed impossible.</p>

            <p>"At that time," Dani continued, "many workers belonged to unions. Unions represented workers and fought for better pay, time off, benefits, and safer conditions. But the rich opposed them fiercely. They bought influence in government and even got elected themselves. Then they passed laws to weaken labor rights. They used media to convince people these changes were good for the country, and for workers. But within two generations, workers lost their rights entirely. They existed only to serve the wealthy.</p>

            <p>"Since the wealthy had become the government, they rewrote the Constitution to benefit only themselves. They claimed all the rights while stripping them away from average citizens. To the rich, it was a zero-sum game; if they didn't win, nobody would. The truth is, we're all part of a game, but the rich are the players, and the rest of us are just the pieces. We have no real control over our own lives."</p>

            <p>Tabitha felt a chill but couldn't look away. When she didn't say anything, Dani finally asked, "So, what do you think of all this, Tabitha?"</p>

            <p>Tabitha swallowed hard. "That can't be right. The way things are now is how they've always been. Our lives are fulfilling, and we find meaning in work and joy in the things we buy." Her hand rose unbidden to brush away a tear she hadn't realized she'd been holding back.</p>

            <p>"This isn't the way it's always been. We're working to make it better. You don't have to live like this. We can fight. We can change it, Tabitha."</p>

            <p>"No, you're wrong," Tabitha snapped, yanking the jack free from the port at the base of her neck and flinging the cord across the room.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>On Monday, Tabitha arrived at work early, her fingers tightening around the new apron she'd just bought. It felt fresh and unfamiliar, like a symbol of a day that might shift everything. She found her manager, Oscar Newbury, and nervously told him what had happened Saturday after work. His pale face hardened as he asked who had given her the cube. At first, Tabitha hesitated, reluctant to betray her friend, but Oscar's cold reminder about her patriotic duty to report anyone spreading anti-worker propaganda broke down her resolve. Dutifully, she confessed everything.</p>

            <p>Back at her workstation, Tabitha waited for the relief she thought would come, but instead of feeling lighter, she struggled to focus. The conveyor belt dragged slowly past her eyes, hour after hour, minute after minute, each second thicker and duller than the last. She bit her lip, desperate not to scream, clinging to the day until its end.</p>

            <p>When the whistle blew and the shift ended, she hung her pristine apron in the locker. She lingered, waiting for the soft whir of the door's motor and the click of the lock to release her. When the door slid open, Tabitha caught sight of Oscar escorting Abigail down the hall. Her friend's face was blank, eyes downcast, unable to meet hers. Tabitha told herself not to feel guilty since Abigail had made her own choices, but the ache in her chest refused to ease. Why couldn't she make herself believe that?</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Two days later, Tabitha sat at her station, eyes fixed on the tiny pieces crawling past on the conveyor belt, untouched and ignored. To her left, Elizabeth worked methodically, assembling components with practiced ease. But to her right, parts moved into Tim's area, unfinished. Tabitha's fingers twitched, but she remained frozen, literally watching her job pass her by.</p>

            <p>As expected, the warning beep sliced through the air, indicating her productivity had dropped. She ignored it. Two seconds later, another beep, louder, then another. The beeps kept coming, five in total, until the conveyor belt in front of her stopped abruptly. A minute later, the lock to her door clicked open. Turning around, she found Oscar standing there, his pale bulk filling the doorway, eyes blazing.</p>

            <p>"Tabitha, why have you stopped working?" he demanded.</p>

            <p>She sighed, her tongue heavy. "I don't feel good," she lied, voice low. "I feel like I'm going to pass out."</p>

            <p>Oscar's eyes narrowed and he sighed. "You have two choices. You can turn around, finish your job plus two hours of unpaid overtime, and accept a write-up. Or you can leave and face likely termination and eviction from your company-provided apartment."</p>

            <p>Tabitha's mind spun. She wanted to obey, to turn and dive back into the mechanical rhythm but suddenly, the thought of the endless monotony, day after day, year after year, felt suffocating. Just days ago, she'd found comfort in her routine and small joys, like new purchases, VR escapes, and the satisfaction of buying. Now, even those felt hollow and meaningless.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry," she said as she stepped past Oscar. "I'm going home."</p>

            <p>She caught a flicker of shock in his eyes and barely suppressed a grin. She looked down the hall at Abigail's old workstation, then at Tim's. She gave his station door a knock. "Don't work too hard, Tim."</p>

            <p>Oscar stopped, staring at Tabitha in shock, but recovered quickly. "Okay, you're fired, Tabitha. Pack your things and leave. I'll notify upper management and they'll take it from here."</p>

            <p>"No problem," she replied without looking back, feeling a strange lightness as she made her way to the factory exit.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Once back in her apartment, she grabbed her backpack and umbrella, smiling at the strange new turn her life had taken twice in less than a week. Looking around the small space one last time, Tabitha realized she didn't want to take much with her. She didn't need all of this useless stuff, these items her society had told her she needed, but which were a burden more than anything else.</p>

            <p>Barely fifteen minutes after arriving home, her TV screen blinked to life with a stern notice; she no longer worked for Orchid Corporation so her right to live in the company building was revoked. The message ended with a notice that she had twenty-four hours to vacate the premises.</p>

            <p>Surprised at her reaction, Tabitha had expected fear and panic to overtake her, that the thought of homelessness, of joining the "lazy" masses outside, to stampede her with anxiety, but none of that came. Instead, a weight lifted, invisible but undeniable. She had no idea how deeply she'd hated this life until now. A week ago, she'd been content, proud to be hardworking, to own so much stuff and now, the realization of how blind and deluded she'd been flushed through her like fire.</p>

            <p>There was no doubt, Danielle and Abigail had saved her, shattered her mental chains, pulled her out of mindless wage slavery. She owed them everything, yet she had betrayed Abigail, handing her over to the company and destroying her friend's life.</p>

            <p>"Well," Tabitha whispered to herself, "I'm about to follow her." The first thing she would do on the streets was find Abigail and apologize, beg forgiveness if she had to. Abigail had given her a gift, and she had repaid it with betrayal.</p>

            <p>Closing the door of her cramped apartment behind her, Tabitha smiled softly. Without hesitation, she stepped into the hallway, grabbed her umbrella from her backpack, popped it open, and stepped out into the sunlight.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Tabitha was just starting down the first flight of stairs, the long descent of twenty-nine flights to ground level, when she heard a voice call out.</p>

            <p>"Tabitha! Hey, Tabitha!"</p>

            <p>She turned, surprised to see one of her former coworkers. It was Tim. She hadn't expected him to come after her, especially since they'd never been friends and had barely exchanged more than a few words.</p>

            <p>"Tim, what are you doing here?" she asked, glancing at her watch. Work had ended only ten minutes ago for him. How had he gotten down here so fast?</p>

            <p>"I ran down here after I got off work," he said, breathing hard. Obviously, he meant that literally.</p>

            <p>Tabitha hesitated. "I, uh, well, we've never really talked before. Why come after me?"</p>

            <p>Tim looked at her, concern plain in his eyes. "What happened? I thought you'd died or something. No one told us anything. Oscar had to finish your shift."</p>

            <p>Tabitha smirked. Oscar had deliberately waited until after their shift to fire Abigail, just so he wouldn't have to work her station. The next day, some poor woman off the streets took Abigail's place, and Tabitha knew her own spot would be filled by tomorrow morning as well. As Dani had told her, the system kept people desperate and homeless, ensuring an endless pool of workers hungry for their chance. She had hammered home how all workers were completely dispensable by design.</p>

            <p>"No, I quit," Tabitha said simply.</p>

            <p>"You quit?" Tim's voice was filled with disbelief. No one had quit willingly in all their time at Orchid Corp. "Why'd you quit?"</p>

            <p>Smiling at her former coworker, Tabitha said, "Because there's more to life than just work, Tim. I'd rather live on the streets and be free than spend another second at that job. Life is more than being a mindless drone making someone else rich while barely scraping by. The system is built to grind us down until we're worthless, so the greedy owners can squeeze one last drop of profit."</p>

            <p>Tim smiled at Tabitha, a huge, genuine smile, which was the opposite of what she expected. Finally, he said, "Come on, follow me."</p>

            <p>They started down the stairs together.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>They didn't speak much as they descended, finally reaching the streets after several minutes. It was Tabitha's first time at ground level, and the first thing she noticed was the reek of trash and piss. However, she was soon distracted by the sheer number of people. They were everywhere, all looking so busy. People moved around each other effortlessly, slipping in and out of open doors, while Tabitha tried her best not to bump into anyone. As they walked, Tabitha looked up and realized the ground floor of the building she had spent her entire life in was filled with businesses. She noticed a restaurant, something called a "dry cleaners," even a public shower. Across the street, inside the USDBank building, she saw a small community theater, a used clothing store, and a small community clinic.</p>

            <p>Tabitha looked around in amazement. The platforms above concealed all this from view, so from higher floors, it just looked like pedestrians walking down the street. Most of the people were dirty, ragged, and thin, but not the mindless degenerates she had imagined. This was a whole different world.</p>

            <p>Tim scanned the street and said, "We're headed just up here, in the International Insurance building next to Orchid Corp. Come on." He jogged ahead, and Tabitha hurried to keep up. Soon, they stopped before a plain metal door with no sign, the nondescript entrance gave no clue what lay beyond, but Tim obviously knew. He pressed a buzzer three times in quick succession. Tabitha couldn't hear anything. Suddenly, a small slot in the door slid open, revealing a pair of eyes.</p>

            <p>"Sebastian, let us in. I have a friend with me," Tim said.</p>

            <p>The eyes studied Tabitha, lingering for a few seconds. "You're willing to vouch for her?" The man's voice was deep and certain.</p>

            <p>"Yes," Tim replied. "She's been through the first sim with Dani. She quit her job today."</p>

            <p>Tabitha took a step back, surprised. "How do you know about Dani?"</p>

            <p>Tim answered, "Because I've talked to Danielle Harper too. So has your friend, Abigail."</p>

            <p>Before Tabitha could respond, the slot closed and the man behind the door unlocked it and swung it open, revealing a tall, fit black man who held it wide.</p>

            <p>"Come on in, Tim," he said. "And you too, Tabitha Bosanac."</p>

            <p>Tim didn't hesitate, stepping through immediately. Tabitha hesitated for a second, looking at Sebastian, who stood waiting with no hint of impatience or frustration on his face. Finally, she took a breath, stepped through the threshold, and found herself standing in a small lobby.</p>

            <p>In the middle of the lobby, a large table was surrounded by several people, all looking up, their work interrupted by the new arrival. To Tabitha's shock, one of the people happened to be her friend, Abigail Barrett.</p>

            <p>As soon as they saw each other, Abigail's eyes went wide and she jumped up, running across the room to Tabitha. Tabitha braced herself for what she knew was coming, but instead of the verbal scolding she expected, Abigail wrapped her in a hug.</p>

            <p>"I knew it," her friend said, voice breaking. "I knew you'd wake up!" Tears spilled freely down her cheeks.</p>

            <p>Tim gave the two a moment, and once they composed themselves, he introduced Tabitha to everyone in the lobby.</p>

            <p>"The man at the door is Sebastian Adebayo. Over here is Zahra Hassan," he said, pointing to a pretty, brown-skinned woman at the table's edge nearest him. "This is John Daniels, next to him is Edward Liu. Across from Eddie is Tara Smith, and next to her, River Watson." As Tim named the people around the table, they waved to her. Tabitha felt awkward, especially after the emotional reunion with Abigail, but she returned their greetings. She wiped her face again, feeling the puffiness from crying.</p>

            <p>Tim continued, "Oh, and behind you is Danielle Harper. I think you know her."</p>

            <p>Tabitha spun around, face to face with the woman from the sim.</p>

            <p>"Hello again, Tabitha. I'm glad to see you here."</p>

            <p>"You're real?" Tabitha asked. "I thought you were just part of the sim."</p>

            <p>Danielle chuckled. "I hear that a lot. Actually, I was interacting with you in real time. We were having a real, live conversation. Most sims don't do that, at least not the ones wage laborers can afford."</p>

            <p>Tabitha struggled to believe it. She'd heard rumors of sims where players could interact with real people connected from the outside world but had never tried one. As Dani said, they were far beyond her budget. She hadn't even been sure they were anything other than rumors.</p>

            <p>"I didn't know it was real," Tabitha told Dani. "It must have been expensive. But I'm sorry, I gave the cube to Oscar Newbury. He's my boss."</p>

            <p>"Yes, I know who Oscar is," Dani said. "He actually plugged into the sim. When I got the alert, I connected with him, but he wasn't interested. He's a true believer in the system and had arguments for everything I said. The arguments were flat and lacked substance, but he believed them. He was actually more interested in me, though. He thought I was part of the sim and wanted to have sex. I just disconnected and left him alone."</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry about that," Tabitha said quietly.</p>

            <p>Dani raised a hand. "No need to apologize. It happens more than you think. I have sims all over the city, and I've had plenty of men and women try to fuck me." She shrugged and continued, "So I'm used to it. Sometimes I still try to wake those people up, and sometimes they're hopeless. You see, sex is one of the most common uses for sims, and we've all done it. I don't blame him for it. What I do blame him for is what he's done to your coworkers."</p>

            <p>Looking around, Tabitha could see the others knew exactly what Dani was talking about, but she had no idea. "What has he done?"</p>

            <p>"Oscar Newbury has the tendency to threaten to fire anyone who doesn't satisfy him sexually. He preys on your coworkers, men and women alike. You wouldn't notice the ones who've left Orchid Corp because they keep you isolated, but anyone who resists gets fired. And since no workplace protections exist, there's nothing the victims can do."</p>

            <p>Tabitha shook her head slowly. "Well, that's part of life, isn't it? Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to, because it's part of your job." When she looked at the other people in the room, she realized she had said something wrong.</p>

            <p>Dani's face twisted in disgust, and Tabitha wondered if it was because of her or because she took Newbury's actions as normal.</p>

            <p>"And this is just one more reason why we have to fight to wake people up. This system teaches people to accept terrible things as normal." She spoke the words as if she had memorized them, as if she had said them a thousand times before. Then, fixing her gaze on Tabitha, she said, "You have so much to be deprogrammed from."</p>

            <p>A sudden beep interrupted her, coming from another room. Dani started walking toward the sound. "Someone just logged into the sim," she said as she entered the next room. She grabbed a VR headset and looked back at Tabitha. "You're welcome to watch on the screen if you want." She pointed to a small, blank monitor on one wall. Walking over to it, she flicked it on, and Tabitha saw the exact same meadow she had been in just days ago. Her curiosity piqued, she followed Dani inside and flinched when she saw her former coworker, Elizabeth, on the monitor.</p>

            <p>"You know her?" Dani asked before donning the headset.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, I do," Tabitha whispered.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Three Years Later</h3>

            <p>Tabitha Bosanac and Sebastian Adebayo sat across from Edward Liu and Elizabeth Serrano, finalizing the plans Dani had asked them to draw up. None of them questioned how Dani had acquired the detailed layouts of every building in New York City, she simply did. Dani had access to many things that couldn't be explained, and Tabitha had soon stopped questioning the woman's sources. Instead, she simply did her job, which at the moment consisted of memorizing those blueprints along with the rest of the people in Dani's group. Several others, including Tim and Zahra, were out in the city doing community outreach, reaching out to disillusioned workers, listening, empathizing, and gathering support for the cause.</p>

            <p>Since fully accepting the brutal reality of the hyper-capitalist system controlling every aspect of life in the United States, Tabitha had quickly risen through the ranks. She was now one of Dani Harper's most trusted labor leaders in New York. Along with the others in Dani's core group, she helped to organize labor groups scattered throughout the country. They had to be united so the autonomous chapters could coordinate and finally challenge the system that literally worked individuals to death so the rich could grow richer.</p>

            <p>After a few minutes of thoughtful silence, Eddie Liu stood and stretched, cracking his back and legs. He headed to the coffee station in the corner and poured himself a fresh cup. "Anyone want some?" he asked, glancing around.</p>

            <p>"I'll take one," Elizabeth said with a smile. Eddie poured her a cup and brought it over. He also brought cream and sugar, and Elizabeth thanked him as he handed her the porcelain mug.</p>

            <p>"Thanks, Eddie," Elizabeth said softly, lifting the cup to her lips. Wisps of steam curled off the hot coffee, dissipating quickly as cooler air from her breath blew across the dark liquid.</p>

            <p>After grabbing his own cup and sitting back down, Eddie turned toward Sebastian and Tabitha. "So, do you think you've pretty much got it down by this point?"</p>

            <p>Sebastian grunted in affirmation. "I think I've got the plan down as well as I'm ever going to, but Dani's right, this is our one shot. If we don't get to the CEO before he's evacuated, it's over before we start."</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded in agreement. "We already know some of them will escape once the attack starts, but Dani said we only need to get to about thirty percent of them for this to work. New York City's huge, and there are a ton of corporate leaders holed up in their ivory towers at any given moment."</p>

            <p>Dani had orchestrated the start of the revolt against the corporate leaders of the United States down to the smallest detail. Her yearlong tour of the United States had rallied more than eighty-five percent of the underground labor groups nationwide to unite behind her vision. Unfortunately, there were still several pockets of idealists who clung to the hope that the system could be reformed from within.</p>

            <p>"The system's too entrenched," Dani had warned. Tabitha attended some of those meetings and could predict who'd stand with Dani and who wouldn't. She had to give it to the woman, Dani was relentless, stubborn in a way that propelled her forward when most would give up. When one city's labor leaders refused, she just hopped on a plane or drove to the next, building momentum city by city.</p>

            <p>After New York, the strongest support came from Dallas, followed closely by Phoenix, Chicago, and Cheyenne. Each city added more labor groups, expanding the network Dani had built from border to border, coast to coast. The excitement in the headquarters beneath the International Insurance Corporation building was palpable, enthusiasm built on hope and purpose as the movement prepared to move from talk to action.</p>

            <p>Tabitha was about to speak again when Dani entered the room. Every pair of eyes turned to her.</p>

            <p>"You're right, Tabitha," Dani said, smiling warmly. "The oligarchs live so comfortably they rarely leave their towers. The head oligarch, the man they call the President of the United States, barely even visits the White House when he's president. That building is more a symbol than a seat of real power now."</p>

            <p>"Oh, hi, Dani," Sebastian greeted her, sliding the building plans toward her. "We were just saying we think we've got the plans down. I think the only person more ready for the Workers' Revolt than us is you."</p>

            <p>Dani returned their smiles, locking eyes with Sebastian a little longer than the others. Tabitha had often wondered if there was anything going on between the two of them, but if there was, they had hidden it well, letting only small hints slip, so small Tabitha could have been imagining it.</p>

            <p>"I'm glad to hear it," Dani answered. "All the exploited workers in this country are ready. Spending your life making someone else rich, barely scraping by, no one wants that. Once the Revolt starts, we'll have support everywhere."</p>

            <p>Looking around the room, Tabitha saw the same fierce hope in every face. This was just the beginning.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>After Dani finished questioning them about their knowledge of the plans and everyone began to file out, Eddie Liu remained behind, slowly rolling up the blueprints. Tabitha was gathering her notes when he looked up at her.</p>

            <p>"You did good work today, Tabitha," he said after putting the blueprints back in the locker in the corner of the room. "These building layouts are complicated, but you picked them up faster than most."</p>

            <p>She paused, surprised by the compliment. In the corporate world, praise was rare and usually came with strings attached. "Thank you, Eddie. You seemed to know a lot about security systems yourself."</p>

            <p>He shrugged, a slight smile crossing his face. "You pick things up when you have to. Before I joined Dani, I worked maintenance for Norvane Group in three of their buildings. You learn how things really work when you're the one fixing them."</p>

            <p>"That's interesting. I had heard you did something like that but never in too much detail."</p>

            <p>Eddie laughed. "We've been working together for three years and we haven't talked too much." He stopped and looked at his watch. "Listen, Tim and Zahra should be back soon. Want to come with me on my rounds after they get here? I could use the company."</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded. Even though Eddie was much younger than her, she sensed she could learn a lot from him.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>An hour later, they stepped out into the bustling street together. Eddie moved easily through the crowds, greeting people by name. "Hey, Carol!" He stopped and waved at an elderly woman selling handmade trinkets, and gave her a dollar for a cheap, wooden bracelet. She smiled as she handed it over and he slipped it onto his wrist with one swift motion.</p>

            <p>"Now I look ready to work," he said, waving at the woman as he started walking off. Tabitha watched the people around him as they walked, noting how his presence seemed to lift people's spirits.</p>

            <p>They turned a corner and came across a small group of children playing with makeshift toys in a narrow alley between buildings. Their clothes were patched and worn, but their laughter was genuine. Eddie's face brightened immediately.</p>

            <p>"Hey there, troublemakers," he called out, and the children rushed toward him.</p>

            <p>"Eddie! Eddie!" a girl of maybe eight years old threw her arms around his waist. "Did you bring us anything?"</p>

            <p>"Well, let me see," Eddie said, making a show of checking his pockets. He pulled out a small bag of wrapped candies and distributed them among the eager hands. But it wasn't the candy that held Tabitha's attention, it was the way Eddie knelt down to their level, listening intently as each child chattered about their day, their games, their small triumphs and disappointments. Before they walked off, Eddie took his new bracelet off and slipped it onto the wrist of the little girl. She smiled and ran off to show her parents what she had gotten.</p>

            <p>As Tabitha and Eddie continued walking around the streets of New York City, Tabitha found herself studying Eddie's profile. "You're really good with them. Not just the adults, but the children as well."</p>

            <p>"Kids deserve better than this," he said simply, his voice carrying a sadness Tabitha had never heard from him before. They walked in silence for a few steps before he continued. "I had a baby once, a little girl."</p>

            <p>Tabitha winced at the past tense.</p>

            <p>"My girlfriend went into labor, but we didn't have the money for a hospital or clinic or anything like that. Couldn't even get a midwife." Eddie continued, his gaze fixed ahead. "I tried to deliver it myself, but I could tell something was wrong. When we went to the Norvane Group ER, they turned us away because we were $200 short of what they were asking. They offered to give me some advice and clean towels if I gave them what I had. I was desperate, so I gave them all my money."</p>

            <p>They had stopped walking. Eddie leaned against a building wall, and Tabitha could see the pain in his eyes even after what must have been years.</p>

            <p>"Most of the towels were used to cover my wife's body and the last one was used to wrap up my daughter. Norvane Group took the bodies and sent me a bill for the costs of removal."</p>

            <p>Tabitha felt tears start to form in her eyes. "Eddie, I'm so sorry."</p>

            <p>"That's when Dani found me, and I understood what she was talking about immediately. It's not just about working conditions or low wages. It's about a system that lets woman and her child die during child birth because their parents can't afford a hospital."</p>

            <p>They stood there for a moment, the sounds of the street continuing around them. Finally, Eddie straightened and managed a sad smile.</p>

            <p>"Those kids back there, they remind me that we're not just fighting against something; we're fighting for something. We're fighting for a world where no parent has to watch their loved ones die because of money."</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded, unable to trust her voice. As they walked back toward headquarters, she understood why Eddie had seemed so calm about the coming assault, so willing to risk everything. For him, some things were worth dying for.</p>

            <p>"Thank you for telling me," she said finally.</p>

            <p>"Thank you for listening," Eddie replied. "Tomorrow's going to be dangerous, Tabitha. But when I think about my girlfriend and our daughter, when I think about those kids back there, I know why we have to do it."</p>

            <p>That night, as Tabitha lay in her small cot in the safe house, she found herself thinking not about the building plans or the weapons, but about Eddie's story, about a woman and her baby who had died because the system valued profit over life. She understood now why the revolution felt so personal to all of them, why they were willing to risk everything for the chance to build something better.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>"Okay, I'm ready," Timothy Hall said over the walkie-talkie.</p>

            <p>Tabitha, Elizabeth, and Zahra stood at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the first-floor platform, waiting for the others to give the signal. River Watson and Sebastian were positioning themselves to create the distraction that would let the four groups slip into the Orchid Corp building unnoticed.</p>

            <p>"I'm ready, too," River's voice came shortly after. Thirty seconds later, Sebastian confirmed he was set.</p>

            <p>"Okay," Zahra said, "counting down. Three, two, one."</p>

            <p>Tabitha inhaled deeply and sprinted up the stairs. She could hear her friends' footsteps pounding just behind her. When they reached the first platform, considered the first floor despite the additional floor at ground level, relief washed over them. No one was in sight. They each pulled out their reflective umbrellas and snapped them open, shielding themselves from the harsh, unforgiving sunlight, which was a danger they could not afford to underestimate.</p>

            <p>The women continued their ascent, pausing at each platform spread every five floors to scan their surroundings carefully. The middle of the workday meant fewer people around, and so far, they moved unchallenged.</p>

            <p>At the warehouse and factory platform, their progress stalled. A lone guard in the shack barely glanced up, focused on something, likely a phone or some other screen. His inattentiveness surprised Tabitha, since she had always imagined guards at rapt attention, always aware of their surroundings. At least, that was how they always seemed before and after her shift.</p>

            <p>"All right, let's immobilize him and move on," Zahra said softly, her umbrella hiding her face as she approached. If a camera had seen her, it would recognize her as unauthorized and alarms would sound immediately.</p>

            <p>After longer than it should have taken, the guard finally noticed Zahra. He rose and stepped out of the shack, muttering something too faint to hear. Zahra replied quietly, then pulled a small cylinder from her pocket. Recognition flashed across the guard's face as he reached for his sidearm, but Zahra was faster. The cylindrical device touched his chest, and he collapsed silently. He would be unconscious for several hours.</p>

            <p>"Guard one down," Elizabeth reported into her walkie-talkie.</p>

            <p>Seconds later came confirmations from the others: John Daniels' team had taken out guard three; Edward's team secured guard four; Timothy Hall reported guard two down. So far, everything was unfolding perfectly.</p>

            <p>After pulling the downed guard out of the sun and locking him in the tower, they climbed to the next platform, which was home to company headquarters, which served as the nerve center for administration, finance, R&D, and advertising. Here, the real challenge would begin. This was where the professionals, those people above the working poor but below the wealthy elite, operated. These were the ones whose manipulation and exploitation were more subtle, the ones who were more likely to help fight to maintain the current order simply because they believed they benefited from it. Tabitha saw these individuals as fellow workers who needed liberation, while others in the movement viewed them as not much better than the real enemies at the top.</p>

            <p>Tabitha eyed two guards stood at the double doors and a third man at the shack nearby. The three women stood there for a moment until the man in the guard shack noticed them. The only people who ever ascended from the lower platform to this one were on the managerial staff, and even that was rare. The professionals didn't like interacting with manual laborers any more than necessary.</p>

            <p>"What are you three doing up here?" the guard in the shack demanded. Tabitha glanced at the other two by the door, but they stood there calmly, still and unmoving as statues. She wasn't fooled, though. She knew they could be on top of her in a second.</p>

            <p>Zahra stepped forward, calm and steady. "There's a problem down below." The guard's hand drifted toward his baton, fingers wrapping around the instrument. "There was a walkout," she finished.</p>

            <p>The guard's eyes widened. The idea of a walkout was almost foreign since nothing like that had happened in several decades.</p>

            <p>"Was there any violence?"</p>

            <p>Zahra shook her head quickly. "No, it's peaceful so far."</p>

            <p>The guard relaxed slightly, reaching for his radio. Before he could speak, Zahra produced the cylinder again, pressing it against his side. He dropped instantly. Seeing this, the other two guards moved without hesitation, grabbing their batons as they lunged toward Zahra. Tabitha noticed one of them was grabbing for his walkie-talkie and Tabitha moved without thinking. She noticed Elizabeth to her right heading for the second guard. Together, they pressed their stunners against them and both of the men crumpled, unconscious. When everything was quiet, the women dragged their victims into the shack and locked the door behind them, then pressed onward. The next platform had only one guard, whom they swiftly subdued.</p>

            <p>Elizabeth fingered her walkie-talkie. "Team one entering the building from the south side. Support teams, ascend to platform 31 and provide backup. Teams two through four, status?"</p>

            <p>Silence hung for a moment before Timothy's voice crackled through: "Team two, ready." Thirty seconds later, Eddie's confirmation, then John Daniels'. Updates rolled in as the support teams climbed higher. When the support team for Tabitha, Zahra, and Elizabeth reached platform 29 – the warehouse and factory level – Tabitha, Elizabeth, and Zahra closed their umbrellas and stepped into the Orchid Corporation's shopping district. The space stopped them cold.</p>

            <p>The interior was unlike anything they'd ever seen. Massive gold pillars soared to a high ceiling adorned with elaborate mythological frescoes, yet the centerpiece was a colossal crystal chandelier casting warm, shimmering light. The floors gleamed with intricate patterns of gold, cream, and onyx, polished to mirror-like shine. Dark mahogany paneling lined the walls, silk tapestries cascading from ceiling to floor. Plush velvet furniture rested atop rich Persian rugs.</p>

            <p>The room was alive with shoppers, men, women, and children skittering across the polished floors like ants, dressed in exquisite garments likely costing more than the three intruders' monthly wages combined.</p>

            <p>At first, no one noticed them, until a woman glanced up, her eyes immediately marking the three women as outsiders. Their worn, ill-fitting clothes, unkempt hair, and lack of the ostentatious hats common in this crowd set them apart. The woman nudged the man beside her, likely her husband and pointed to the three women. The man turned, eyes widening, and hurried her forward, hand on her back. Tabitha watched as he approached a guard and pointed toward them. The guard studied the trio, then spoke into his walkie-talkie before advancing.</p>

            <p>"May I help you three ladies?" he asked as he approached, voice stern but polite.</p>

            <p>"No, we're just here looking around," Tabitha responded, nonchalant.</p>

            <p>"Well, I'm going to have to ask each of you to leave," he said, motioning toward the doors they'd entered.</p>

            <p>"Why?" Zahra asked, stepping forward. "Is there a law against us being here?"</p>

            <p>The guard faltered. There was no explicit law barring them from the upper floors, but the unspoken rule was clear: the rich stayed with the rich; the poor, with the poor. Only security personnel, all of whom lived on the two levels directly below the warehouse and factory level, were tolerated in the upper floors.</p>

            <p>"Ma'am," he said, deciding to ignore the question entirely, "please exit the lobby and return to the lower levels."</p>

            <p>"No," Zahra said firmly. "We're going to look around."</p>

            <p>"Okay, please tell me your names so I can notify your managers, since you should really be working."</p>

            <p>Elizabeth cut in smoothly. "Oh, we don't work for Orchid Corp."</p>

            <p>After the guard processed Elizabeth's words, he reached for his radio again, but Zahra was quicker, pressing her stunner to his temple. He crumpled to the ground like a marionette with its strings suddenly cut.</p>

            <p>Then the screaming started.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Tabitha, Zahra, and Elizabeth sprinted across the lobby toward a bank of elevators set into the far wall. When Zahra slammed her palm against the up button a digital display over the elevator doors showed the nearest car descending from ten floors above. According to Dani's schematics, that level was residential space, well above the specialized security forces quartered deeper down. If the elevator had been dropping from those barracks, the plan was clear, abandon it and take the stairs, climbing the long way toward the top.</p>

            <p>The car arrived empty, relief flickering across all three women's faces as the doors slid open with a hiss. They stepped forward, but footsteps echoed behind them across the marble floor. Tabitha spun, ready to fight, until she recognized the dozen figures of their support team filing through the doors.</p>

            <p>"Remember, five per elevator," she called out, her voice low but firm. "We ride up to forty-one, then stairs the rest of the way. C-suite level from there."</p>

            <p>Two men peeled off and joined their car. Elizabeth thumbed the button for the forty-first floor, and the doors sealed shut. Another soft ding in the distance signaled that a second elevator had arrived for the next group.</p>

            <p>As the lift began its ascent, the taller of the two men sank to one knee, unshouldering a heavy pack. He was broad-shouldered with dark red hair and a beard that burned almost the same shade. He unzipped the pack and drew out pistols, one after another, handing them over.</p>

            <p>The advance team hadn't risked carrying weapons through the lobby; there had been too great a chance of metal detectors. Dani had insisted she was nearly certain there weren't any before the elevator banks, but in the end no one had been willing to gamble. They all agreed it was better to smuggle them in with the support unit.</p>

            <p>"Thank you," Tabitha murmured as she holstered the sidearm, standard issue among the Workers' Revolution, before accepting a second weapon, an SMG. This one was long and heavy, Dani's prize acquisitions.</p>

            <p>The pistols had been simple enough to stockpile; submachine guns were another story. The variety spoke to the difficulty of procurement, and each member of the team had spent long hours training across several models until they found one that fit. Tabitha had chosen a Beretta M12, solid in her hands, while Elizabeth and Zahra each claimed AR-57s. One by one they checked chambers, safeties, magazines, then pressed themselves flat against the walls, ready for whatever waited at the next stop.</p>

            <p>When the elevator reached forty-one, the doors parted with a soft chime. A knot of men stood beyond, batons in hand, not firearms. Tabitha realized in an instant they'd expected resistance, but not firearms.</p>

            <p>The two male fighters who had joined them in the elevator surged out first, rifles leveled. The baton-men froze, then dropped their weapons in surrender. Tabitha and the others didn't hesitate; their stunners crackled, dropping each opponent cleanly to the floor.</p>

            <p>"Too easy," Zahra muttered, scanning the fallen men. Then her eyes narrowed. She crouched, tapping a small black device clipped to one man's shoulder. "This is a camera, the type that transmits a live feed, almost certainly. That means guns next time."</p>

            <p>She rose, weapon tight against her shoulder, and nodded toward the stairwell door. "I'll take point." Her gaze shifted to the second man, who was shorter with dark-hair and Middle Eastern features. "You bring up the rear."</p>

            <p>He gave a short nod and fell back.</p>

            <p>Zahra eased the stairwell door open, barrel steady, cheek pressed to her sight. The echo inside was hollow and cold. "Clear," she whispered, stepping through.</p>

            <p>The CEO's office was still several of flights above, anchored at the north end of the building. Four stairwells cut through to the top floor, and their plan hinged on timing, all four assault groups converging at once, or as close to each other as possible. Only then would they breach the office together and force the surrender they had come for.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>As the five of them ascended toward the fifty-first floor, Tabitha strained to hear anything beyond their own footsteps echoing off concrete walls. At first, there was nothing, no boots thundering down from above, no gunfire, no shouted orders – no resistance whatsoever. The only sounds they made was the soft whisper of their breathing and the scrape of fabric against painted walls.</p>

            <p>Dani had warned them to prepare for nonstop combat from the thirty-first floor up, but she'd also offered a contradictory assessment. "Nothing like this has ever happened before. The oligarchs have maintained complete control through massive brainwashing campaigns targeting your parents, your grandparents, even you. Don't be surprised if they're wholly unprepared for something like this. Many of their security forces have never seen real combat. It's viewed as a cushy job with very little responsibility."</p>

            <p>The element of surprise and the guards' inexperience were supposed to work in their favor but Dani hadn't wanted them relying on that advantage. They couldn't afford to grow complacent as they climbed toward their goal.</p>

            <p>Tabitha had steeled herself against expecting smooth passage, but she still flinched when a volley of gunshots cracked from several floors above. The sound ricocheted off the walls like trapped thunder. The group pressed themselves against the landing's concrete wall, hearts hammering, waiting for the echoes to die.</p>

            <p>After several seconds of silence, Tabitha leaned forward just enough to peer up the stairwell. Half a dozen armed figures were positioned above them, weapons trained downward. She had only a split second to register their positions before a hand yanked her back against the wall. A bullet sparked off the spot where her head had been, leaving a gray scar in the concrete. More gunfire erupted from above, muzzle flashes strobing like deadly lightning.</p>

            <p>"Unidentified assailants!" a voice boomed down the stairwell. "Throw your weapons into the center stairwell and surrender!"</p>

            <p>"We can't keep advancing," the redhead said, his voice serious. "What's our play?"</p>

            <p>"How many extra weapons do we have?" Zahra asked.</p>

            <p>"Three spare SMGs and a couple hand grenades, just in case. Why?"</p>

            <p>"Give me one of the guns." Zahra's voice carried the kind of calm Tabitha could only wish she felt.</p>

            <p>The man reached into his pack and handed her an extra weapon. She released the magazine, handed it to the redhead man, then held the gun out where their enemies could see it.</p>

            <p>"Okay, we surrender," she called up the stairwell. "We'll dispose of our weapons."</p>

            <p>"Smart choice," came the reply from above. "Slowly hold each weapon over the railing and drop it down the center. Once that's done, come up the stairs with your hands visible at all times. Deviate from these instructions and you will be shot."</p>

            <p>Zahra held the extra gun over the railing, then let it fall. Tabitha held her breath as the weapon clattered down the stairwell, waiting for the gunfire that would end everything. None came.</p>

            <p>"We know you have more weapons. Drop all of them."</p>

            <p>"Okay, dropping the second weapon now." Zahra leaned over and released the second gun. It fell with a series of metallic bangs until it struck bottom far below.</p>

            <p>"How many other weapons do you have?" the voice demanded.</p>

            <p>"One more. Dropping it now." The third gun followed its companions into the depths.</p>

            <p>When the noise stopped, Zahra called, "What do you want us to do now?"</p>

            <p>"How many of you are there?"</p>

            <p>"Five. Three women and two men."</p>

            <p>"Come up one at a time. You, the one I'm speaking with, go first."</p>

            <p>Zahra turned to face the group, her expression unreadable. She handed her Beretta to the redhead, who slung it over his shoulder alongside his own weapon.</p>

            <p>"Can you give me one of those grenades?" she asked as he closed the backpack.</p>

            <p>He nodded, reached inside, and produced a hand grenade. Zahra slipped it inside her jacket pocket and then looked at each of them in turn. "When you hear the bang, come running."</p>

            <p>"Good luck," Tabitha whispered.</p>

            <p>"I'm unarmed," Zahra called up the stairwell, raising her hands where they could be seen. "Coming up slowly as you requested."</p>

            <p>"That's good. Keep moving."</p>

            <p>Tabitha watched Zahra climb the stairs until she disappeared around the curve. The silence that followed was excruciating.</p>

            <p>"Everyone get ready to back her up," the redhead said, tightening his grip on his AR-57 and moving to the front of their group.</p>

            <p>Seconds later, an explosion shattered the quiet. The sound of screaming men made its way down to the group. The redhead took off running immediately, with Tabitha, Elizabeth, and the other man close behind.</p>

            <p>The sound of pistol fire made Tabitha flinch, but she didn't stop running.</p>

            <p>When the redhead rounded the corner to the fiftieth floor, he reached out and pulled someone back, Zahra, alive and moving. She pressed herself against the wall, grabbed her backpack, and pulled out her AR-57. Safety off, she positioned herself behind the redhead and began firing over his shoulder.</p>

            <p>Tabitha, Elizabeth, and the other man took position behind them, weapons ready, waiting for orders to join the fight.</p>

            <p>When the redhead stopped to reload, he stepped back and Elizabeth took his place. When Zahra's magazine ran dry, the other man moved forward to join Elizabeth's covering fire.</p>

            <p>"How many left?" Tabitha asked Zahra.</p>

            <p>"There were five. Grenade took out two, I shot one with my pistol. These guys aren't as sharp as I expected."</p>

            <p>Tabitha nodded, preparing to replace Elizabeth who was backing up with an empty weapon, when inspiration struck. She turned around, grabbed a grenade from the bag, and stepped beside the other man.</p>

            <p>"Give me cover fire."</p>

            <p>He flicked a switch on his weapon, changing from controlled bursts to sustained fire. She moved past him, careful to stay out of his line of fire, and positioned herself at the edge of the stairs.</p>

            <p>Taking a deep breath, she pulled the pin and prayed the grenade wouldn't roll back down to kill them all. She cocked her arm back and hurled it up the stairs where the remaining guards were firing from. She dove back and crouched against the wall, the others following her lead.</p>

            <p>From above, someone shouted an expletive, then the explosion came. After a few seconds of ringing silence, Tabitha looked at the others. "I'll go check." Slowly, she started to ascend the stairs, her boots scraping against concrete gritty with debris. The acrid smell of gunpowder hung thick in the stairwell. When she rounded the corner to the next landing, she saw a dead body, half his face and torso were simply gone, the concrete wall behind him splattered dark. Behind him lay another corpse riddled with bullet wounds, his security uniform soaked crimson.</p>

            <p>She kept moving up the steps, hyperaware of every shadow, when she noticed someone behind her. She turned to see the redhead man, his jaw set with the kind of grim determination she'd seen in old war photographs. All of a sudden, she wished she had gotten his name, wished she knew something about this stranger she was fighting beside.</p>

            <p>"I see two more. Looks like the grenade got them," the man said, his voice steady despite the carnage. He extended his finger and Tabitha followed his gaze. Sure enough, two more bodies lay twisted where her grenade had found them, their limbs at impossible angles.</p>

            <p>"Where's the last one?" she muttered.</p>

            <p>He shook his head and shrugged, weapon still raised.</p>

            <p>They both paused. Tabitha glanced back, catching Elizabeth's eye and motioning for the others to follow. When she turned back to continue up the stairs, a low groan echoed from above.</p>

            <p>"Help me," a man's voice called weakly.</p>

            <p>Tabitha's grip tightened on her weapon as she started up the final set of stairs, each step deliberate. At the top, she found a man slumped against the wall, blood trickling from a gash on his forehead. His eyes were squeezed shut, but she could see his chest rising and falling steadily. From what she could tell, most of him was still intact.</p>

            <p>Beside her, the redhead man lowered his weapon and approached the wounded guard. When he knelt beside him, his movements were surprisingly gentle. "Here, let me help you."</p>

            <p>The wounded man's eyelids fluttered open, revealing confused, pain-dulled eyes. "Why are you people doing this?" His gaze shifted to Tabitha as she reached the landing, studying her face as if searching for something he could understand.</p>

            <p>"We're doing this because we want to be free," she said, surprised by how steady her own voice sounded.</p>

            <p>"I don't understand." The man's eyes closed again, his breathing deep but labored.</p>

            <p>The redhead examined him carefully, checking for wounds. "I don't think he's hurt too badly. Looks like he caught some shrapnel from the grenade, but he wasn't in the kill radius. He should make it."</p>

            <p>"Good." The word came out more relieved than Tabitha had expected. Something about seeing this stranger show mercy amid all the violence made her feel overcome with an emotion she couldn't quite name. She managed a small smile. "By the way, my name is Tabitha."</p>

            <p>The man looked up at her, his eyes crinkling slightly. "Stephen Webber. But most people call me Steve."</p>

            <p>"Good to meet you, Steve."</p>

            <p>"You too, Tabitha."</p>

            <p>From behind them, Zahra's voice cut through the moment like a blade. "All right, you two. Introductions later. We're almost there." She stepped past them toward the door marked with a bold "51," her movements all business again. But before her hand could reach the handle, the sharp crack of automatic gunfire erupted from beyond the door.</p>

            <p>"Everyone, weapons hot," Zahra barked, and flung the door open.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>When Tabitha and her group stepped out into the hallway, they spotted Eddie Liu's team up ahead, crouched behind a wall. One person was isolated in the middle of a clearing, taking cover behind a pillar.</p>

            <p>As they moved toward their allies, Tabitha noticed a hallway branching off to their left. Curious, she tapped Steve Webber's shoulder and they veered down it, following until they reached an intersection. Peering right, she saw a lobby where several Orchid Corp security forces were firing blindly at what she assumed was Eddie's team.</p>

            <p>"They're not even watching this side," she murmured to Steve.</p>

            <p>"Idiots," Steve muttered, already stepping forward. Tabitha didn't hesitate to follow. "These guys are all pretty much untrained. A lot of them are promoted into these roles instead of gaining them through direct experience. Something like this had never happened before, so they've gotten lazy, assuming it never will."</p>

            <p>Once in range, Steve reached into his bag and pulled out their last grenade. With a steady hand, he pulled the pin and lobbed the explosive carefully into the enemy ranks. It rolled unnoticed right up to the guards. Before it went off, Tabitha and Steve ducked into a small room off the hallway, bracing themselves as the grenade detonated in a thunderous blast.</p>

            <p>When the gunfire ceased, Tabitha counted silently to ten before peeking out. The grenade had done its work, every last security officer lay still. The ones who hadn't been caught in the blast had been eliminated by the rest of the fighters. Relief rushed through her, and she turned to Steve, smiling.</p>

            <p>But the moment they stepped into the lobby, her heart sank.</p>

            <p>Her people had suffered devastating losses, eight casualties, seven dead, one wounded and writhing on the floor. Among the fallen, she recognized John Daniels. She shook her head in sorrow, despite barely knowing him.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a sharp cry pulled her attention. Elizabeth Serrano knelt by the injured man, carefully rolling him onto his back. It was Eddie Liu, a dark, bloody wound centered just beneath his diaphragm. His breaths came shallow and ragged, eyes wide with pain and fear.</p>

            <p>The room froze. Eddie had been among the first to answer Dani's call for revolution. Losing him here would be a cruel blow to their fragile morale.</p>

            <p>"We can't stop now," a voice urged. Tabitha turned to see Dani standing near the back with Sebastian Adebayo, River Watson, and a handful of unfamiliar faces.</p>

            <p>Stepping forward, Dani said, "Reinforcements will be here soon. We have to get into the CEO's office. Sebastian, get Eddie out of here."</p>

            <p>Sebastian bent down, gently lifting Eddie as he whispered reassurance. Eddie's eyes met his, fright clear in their depths.</p>

            <p>Turning back to the group, about twenty strong, not including Dani's core circle, Dani commanded, "We're going to confront the rich bastard inside this room. Everyone, find cover, get into position, and don't let anyone through that door. Steve, because of your military training, you're in charge."</p>

            <p>Steve Webber nodded once and began barking out orders. The ragtag fighters quickly spread out, loading weapons and bracing for the fight ahead. Tabitha cast one last glance at him and they exchanged a tired smile before he began reloading. She found herself hoping he was still alive when they walked out of the office, hopefully with the head of Orchid Corp with them.</p>

            <p>She turned back just as Danielle pushed open the CEO's office door. Gunfire erupted instantly. The group dove for cover, returning fire fiercely. The CEO's last line of defense was three security officers desperate to hold the door. Tabitha raised her weapon, flanked by Zahra, Elizabeth, and Tim, unleashing a volley that swiftly dropped the guards. Together, the seven members of Dani's core group, including Sebastian and Eddie, entered the room.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>The CEO was crouched beneath his desk, quietly weeping. Tabitha wanted to feel a shred of empathy, but it was quickly swallowed by the memory of everything he'd done, her former employer, a man who had inflicted so much pain and suffering on his workers just to live a life of luxury at their expense. He didn't deserve her mercy.</p>

            <p>"Come out, and we won't shoot," Dani's voice called firmly.</p>

            <p>The CEO stopped crying and said, "Dani?" Suddenly, a trembling hand gripped the edge of the table as the frightened man pulled himself upright.</p>

            <p>"Hello, Dad," Dani said, her weapon still trained on him. From behind her, Tabitha caught Elizabeth's gasp at the sudden revelation. Dani stepped forward, setting the gun carefully on the desk, just out of the man's reach.</p>

            <p>"Danielle, sweetie," the CEO said, looking around at the other people in the room with his daughter, "what's going on here?" When he stopped talking, his eyes fell on the three dead bodies on the ground by his desk. He straightened slightly, and Tabitha could see him shifting into a different mode, the executive who'd built an empire replacing the cowering man.</p>

            <p>"Well, Dad," Dani said, speaking with the measured tone of someone delivering a verdict, "we're here to end the corporate tyranny you and your buddies have perpetuated."</p>

            <p>"I don't understand this, Danielle. Help me grasp what's happening here." He gestured slowly toward the bodies. "This is violence and chaos. This can't be what you wanted. This isn't who you are." He then turned toward the armed people surrounding him, his gaze moving from face to face as if trying to understand what had turned his daughter against everything he'd built. "Why are you doing this?"</p>

            <p>Dani's jaw tightened. "Because what you've been doing all this time is wrong. You exploit, abuse, and hurt others just so you can squeeze as much profit as you can out of them. It's over. The workers have had enough."</p>

            <p>"But why you, sweetie? You had everything. What made you do this?"</p>

            <p>"You really don't remember, Dad? You don't remember Reynaldo and what you did to him?"</p>

            <p>His eyes flickered, confusion creasing his brow for a moment before recognition dawned. "That boy? Dani, that was over ten years ago. You're doing all this over a fling?"</p>

            <p>"A fling?" Dani's voice cracked, then hardened. She stood up and leaned over the desk, her face less than a meter from her father's. "You don't know anything about what happened between Rey and me. We were together for over a year before you found out. I begged you to spare him, and you fired him anyway. You made him homeless. You said you were doing what was best for me."</p>

            <p>The man swallowed hard, his executive composure wavering. "Sweetie, look, I'll find him. I'll bring him back if you call this off. Honestly, I didn't realize how much he meant to you. I thought it was just a phase you were going through."</p>

            <p>Dani shook her head, bitter laughter escaping her lips. "No, Dad, he's dead. I searched for him and found out he was killed because he didn't know how to survive on the streets. He was on the wrong street at the wrong time and someone murdered him for the few dollars in his pocket. He's dead because you're heartless." The last words came out as almost a scream.</p>

            <p>Tabitha watched her father's face change as the reality of what his daughter was telling him sank in. The color drained from his cheeks, but when he spoke, his voice carried the patient tone of someone explaining basic facts to a confused child.</p>

            <p>"Dani, I'm sorry. I really am. I truly didn't know what happened to him." He paused, seeming to gather his thoughts. "But sweetheart, you have to understand. I was protecting you. That boy, he wasn't like us. He didn't think the way we do. He was content to spend his entire life attaching components to circuit boards. He never showed any ambition, any drive to improve himself."</p>

            <p>"He was 'content'?" Dani's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.</p>

            <p>"Yes, content. Look, the boy was pleasant enough, but he was simple. He thought in very basic terms, day to day, paycheck to paycheck. If I'd let you stay with him, in five years you would have been miserable, you'd have had no hope, wondering why you had chosen someone who wasn't your equal in any way."</p>

            <p>"You don't know anything about Rey."</p>

            <p>"I know enough. I know he was happy to live his entire life without any real responsibility. Danielle, in the old days, before our system, people like Reynaldo would have been unemployed, living off government handouts. We gave him purpose, dignity, a steady paycheck. We gave him more than he would have had in any other system in history."</p>

            <p>"We?" Dani repeated, her voice flat.</p>

            <p>"Yes, we. The people who plan, who invest, who take risks, who make the hard decisions that keep everything running. Do you think Reynaldo ever worried about supply chain logistics? Market fluctuations? Resource allocation? He showed up, did his simple task, got paid, went home. That's not suffering, Danielle. That's freedom from the burden of poverty."</p>

            <p>Tabitha watched something shift behind Dani's eyes. The personal pain was still there, but it was crystallizing into something sharper, more focused.</p>

            <p>"Tell me about the bathroom fees, Dad."</p>

            <p>"What?" He blinked, thrown by the sudden change of subject.</p>

            <p>"The bathroom fees. In the worker levels. Three dollars to use the toilet, a dollar for soap, another dollar for paper towels."</p>

            <p>Her father looked genuinely puzzled, as if she were asking about some minor administrative detail. "What about them?"</p>

            <p>"Explain to me how charging people money to perform basic bodily functions gives them dignity."</p>

            <p>"Danielle, everything costs money to maintain. The water, the sewage processing, the cleaning supplies, the maintenance staff. Should I just absorb those costs? Should I pay for workers to use facilities without any accountability? Before we implemented usage fees, workers would use excessive amounts of supplies. The fees created responsibility."</p>

            <p>"A roll of paper towels costs a dollar. You charge them that much for just two individual towels."</p>

            <p>"I shouldn't be allowed to make a profit?" His face showed something that bordered on amusement at the very idea.</p>

            <p>"What about the parks, Dad? The fees to sit under trees? In what possible reality is charging a fee to sit under a tree in the shade logical or fair?"</p>

            <p>"Maintenance costs, Danielle. Landscaping, security, cleaning crews. And frankly, the fees help ensure that only people who truly value the experience use the facilities. Otherwise, you get overcrowding, littering and excessive noise. The fees create a natural filter."</p>

            <p>Dani stared at him for a long moment. "Dad, do you hear yourself?"</p>

            <p>"I hear someone explaining basic economic principles to their daughter who seems to have forgotten everything she was taught about how the real world works."</p>

            <p>"The real world," Dani repeated slowly. "Dad, I want you to imagine something. Imagine Rey had been born into our family instead of his. Imagine he'd had our education, our connections, our resources. And imagine you'd been born into his circumstances. Do you think the results would have been different?"</p>

            <p>Her father was quiet for a moment, his fingers drumming against the desk's polished surface. When he spoke, his voice carried absolute certainty. "Danielle, that's a fantasy. People aren't interchangeable pieces. Rey might have been a nice boy, but he didn't have what it takes to run a corporation. The intelligence and vision, the ability to make hard decisions under pressure. Those aren't things you can just teach someone."</p>

            <p>"How do you know?"</p>

            <p>"Because I met him, Danielle. I talked to him. He was..." He paused and then said, "he was pleasant enough, but limited. He couldn't see the bigger picture, couldn't think strategically. When I asked him about his goals, his plans, he just looked confused. He lived entirely in the present moment."</p>

            <p>"He was twenty-one years old, Dad. He'd been working seventy-two-hour weeks since he was sixteen. When exactly was he supposed to develop strategic thinking? Between his shifts? During his five-minute bathroom breaks that he had to pay for?"</p>

            <p>Her father's expression grew slightly impatient, the look of someone whose time was being wasted. "Danielle, I can see you've thought about this a lot, and I understand you're grieving. But you're being emotional rather than rational. Some people are leaders, some are followers, some are innovators, some are implementers; that's not oppression, that's specialization. That's how efficient societies function."</p>

            <p>"And who decides who's a leader and who's a follower?"</p>

            <p>"Merit decides." He gestured around his opulent office. "We live in a meritocracy, Dani. Do you think I could have built and maintained all this if I wasn't capable? Do you think the board would have kept me in control if I wasn't producing results?"</p>

            <p>"You earned all of this, dad? You inherited everything from your father who inherited it from his father who inherited it from his father. None of this was earned. It was luck and exploitation and because we just happen to have the right last name, we're on top. We've done nothing to deserve anything we have."</p>

            <p>Her father leaned back in his chair, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth, looking for all the world like he thought this was funny. "Danielle, yes, there's inheritance, but that's because we've proven ourselves across generations. Wealth isn't just money, it's responsibility. It's the knowledge of how to manage resources, how to make decisions that affect thousands of lives. That gets passed down because it works."</p>

            <p>"Name one person, dad, just one who rose from the ranks of the workers to running a corporation in America, someone who became so rich through hard work and 'merit' that they rose to a government position. Name even one senator or representative who wasn't born into a rich family."</p>

            <p>Dani's father looked up at the ceiling and narrowed his eyes, thinking. Finally, after a few seconds, he said, "Look, Dani. This system works. That's all there is to it."</p>

            <p>"It works for who?"</p>

            <p>"For everyone. Look at what we've built." He gestured toward the window, toward the city beyond. "Yes, there's hierarchy, but that's natural. That's how human societies have always functioned."</p>

            <p>Dani leaned back in her chair, studying her father's face. "Dad, when's the last time you worked a twelve-hour shift standing at a conveyor belt?"</p>

            <p>"That's not the same thing, Danielle. I work eighteen-hour days making decisions that affect – "</p>

            <p>But Dani wasn't done. "When's the last time you had to choose between eating dinner and paying to use the bathroom?"</p>

            <p>"Danielle – " Her father tried again to speak but Dani wasn't going to stop. Nothing he said could justify the system he helped maintain.</p>

            <p>"When's the last time you worried about being fired because you got sick? When's the last time you felt afraid every single day that one mistake would cost you everything?"</p>

            <p>Her father's voice grew harder. "Danielle, that's exactly my point. I don't have to worry about those things because I've earned the right not to worry about them. And more importantly, I've created a system where people don't have to make impossible choices. Everyone in this building has food, shelter, medical care, and job security, as long as they fulfill their responsibilities."</p>

            <p>"They have job security for as long as they do what you tell them to do. They have food and medical care as long as they have the money for it, which is something they don't often have. You don't pay them enough to afford basic medical care."</p>

            <p>"That's how things work, Danielle. That's how it's always worked. Food production and medical care cost money and in the long run, it's a business. We have to make profit to keep the business going. Maybe if you tried to work – "</p>

            <p>All of a sudden Dani yelled for her father to shot up, picking up her gun and pointing it at him. He stopped talking and a silence filled the room. When Dani spoke again, her voice was steady, almost conversational. "Dad, I tried to work within your system. Do you remember? When I was in my twenties, I asked you to increase worker wages. You told me it would hurt competitiveness. When I asked about reducing hours, you said it would hurt productivity. When I asked about removing the bathroom fees, you said it would create fiscal irresponsibility."</p>

            <p>"Because those weren't realistic suggestions, Danielle. They were idealistic fantasies that ignored basic economic realities."</p>

            <p>"And this conversation proves that the system can't be reformed. You genuinely believe everything you've just said. You genuinely think you're being benevolent."</p>

            <p>Her father looked at her with something approaching pity. "Danielle, you've been seduced by the oldest lie in human history, the idea that you can create paradise on earth. People aren't perfectible. They need structure, hierarchy and someone to make the hard decisions. All we can do is create stable systems that work with human nature as it actually exists."</p>

            <p>When Dani didn't say anything, her father spoke again. There was a look on his face as he started to speak, a look that said he had figured out the one thing Dani was missing. "You know, Dani, I didn't raise you to be a hypocrite. Your apathy didn't stop you from taking my money and using it for yourself." He pointed at her like she needed to be ashamed of herself. "You were more than happy to take the money and fly all over the country, staying in high-end hotels and eating at fancy restaurants. You've enjoyed my money just as much as I have."</p>

            <p>Dani smirked. "Actually, those trips were to organize the Workers Revolt. Do you really think this is an isolated event, dad? Our people are in every building, confronting your colleagues, just like I'm doing right now. We've been planning this for years."</p>

            <p>Her father slumped in his chair, realizing this was more serious than he had originally thought. His arrogance was still obvious though, as he decided on a different strategy.</p>

            <p>"Okay, you're serious about your revolution," he said, his voice taking on the tone of a man making a business deal. "Well, how about this. I'll give each of you jobs in Orchid Corp and I'll pay each of you, let's see, how does $100,000 a year sound? You'll be on the books, making money and you won't have to do anything. You can move up to the higher floors and have everything you want with no responsibility."</p>

            <p>No one moved. Tabitha didn't even glance at the others to gauge their reactions. The silence stretched until it became uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>"Nice try, Dad," Dani said finally. "You know why these people are in this room with me? It's because I know that you can't buy them. They hate your system as much as I do."</p>

            <p>Her father's eyes darted around the room, panic creeping back into his voice. "Fine. How about I pay each of you $200,000 a year? 250?" He looked from face to face, searching for any sign of interest. "A million? I'll pay you a million a year each to drop this and convince everyone to stop this revolt."</p>

            <p>Again, silence. Dani's smile was cold. "See, Dad. Not everyone cares about money."</p>

            <p>Her father wasn't finished. His gaze settled on Eddie, who was being propped up by Sebastian, blood still seeping from his wound. "How about you, young man? Help me convince them to stop and I'll get you medical care right now, no questions asked. You're hurt. What good is a revolt if you're dead? Come on, one phone call and I'll have people in here to help fix you up within a couple of minutes."</p>

            <p>Tabitha looked at Eddie, whose breathing had grown more labored. He took a short, shallow breath and whispered, "Fuck you." He coughed at the effort and blood spattered from his mouth. He slumped further in Sebastian's arms.</p>

            <p>"Jesus, Dani," her father pleaded, the business facade cracking completely. "Okay, how about this? I'll reform Orchid Corp. We'll go back to the old days. Eight hours a day, five days a week. Two days off, vacation days, sick days." He stopped, looking into her eyes. When she didn't say anything, he added, "I'll raise everyone's pay, huh?"</p>

            <p>Dani shook her head. "It's too little, too late. What about the fact they're paid in company scrip and can only use your fake money to buy things you produce and sell? Or the fact they can't spend money anywhere else without running the risk of getting fired? Or the fact they can't even be friends with someone of the opposite sex because it might hurt productivity?"</p>

            <p>"Fine. I'll abolish all of that. You make your demands and if they're reasonable I'll make sure to implement them."</p>

            <p>"What about all the other corporations? There are millions and millions of Americans who suffer through these conditions and you and your buddies laugh about it. I've heard you make fun of them at your dinner parties and company meetings. Hell, you even abuse the richer professionals that live and work on the higher levels. The parks, the trees, the shade, the water fountains – they have to pay to access all of that. Goddammit, Dad, you charge them money to sit under a fucking tree in the shade."</p>

            <p>Her father's voice grew smaller, more desperate. "I can talk to the other CEOs. We can coordinate reforms across the industry. Just give me a chance – "</p>

            <p>"No, Dad. The system is too far gone to be reformed. Our only option is to topple it and rebuild."</p>

            <p>From outside, the sharp crack of gunfire tore through the air, tangled with shouts and screams. Abigail's voice cut through the chaos, barking urgent orders.</p>

            <p>From outside in the lobby, Tabitha suddenly heard Steve Webber start to bark out orders. Gunfire erupted a few moments later.</p>

            <p>"Call them off, Dad," Dani demanded, her voice fierce. "Call off the Orchid Security Forces."</p>

            <p>"It's too late," her father replied, and Tabitha heard a note of satisfaction creep into his voice. The sound of his security forces engaging Dani's people had restored some of his confidence. "They'll be here any second. Your revolution ends the moment they step through that door."</p>

            <p>Dani stared at him for a long moment, then reached for the pistol resting on the desk. "Then I guess we're done talking."</p>

            <p>"Wait, Danielle – " Her father's voice cracked, the executive composure finally crumbling. "Please, sweetheart, you don't have to do this. We can work something out. I can make changes, real changes."</p>

            <p>"No, Dad. You can't. Because you don't even understand what needs to change." She reached out and picked up the pistol she had laid on the desk.</p>

            <p>"Dani, you'll kill your own father?"</p>

            <p>"No," she said, looking at Timothy Hall. "He will."</p>

            <p>Timothy's hand moved to his sidearm, the pistol rising to aim squarely at her father's forehead.</p>

            <p>"Wait, Danielle. Please – " he started, but the shot cut through the air. Mr. Harper slumped back in his chair, blood splattering the wall behind him.</p>

            <p>For a few seconds, there was silence. Even the shooting outside seemed to have ceased. Finally, a single, raw sob escaped from Dani's lips and then she gained control of herself. After a moment, she rose and walked around her father's desk. She found a button and then pressed it. A faint beep came from a speaker in the corner, and then Dani's voice could be heard both inside the office and out in the lobby. The gunfire outside stopped.</p>

            <p>As Dani spoke, her voice echoed throughout the entire Orchid Corp building. "Attention. This is Danielle Harper. My father, the CEO, is dead. I demand all members of the Orchid Security Force lower your weapons. This fight is over."</p>

            <p>Outside, Tabitha listened, but there was no more gunfire. She turned and looked at the leader of the Workers' Revolt, her face strong and resolute, the streaks of tears having the surprising effect of making her look stronger. Finally, she spoke again, her voice softer but resolute. "Okay. Let's get to the roof." She moved toward the double doors with purpose.</p>

            <p>Timothy re-holstered his weapon while Sebastian stepped forward, reaching out to help Eddie rise. Elizabeth took the other side, sharing the wounded man's weight. Zahra and Tabitha followed silently, closing ranks behind Dani as the office doors swung open into the quiet lobby.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>The scene in the lobby was horrific. Five more of their group lay fallen, blood pooling beneath them, while only three Orchid Security Force members had been killed. Every eye turned to Dani as she stepped forward toward the highest-ranking OSF officer standing among the survivors. He met her gaze without hesitation as she spoke a few curt words. Without argument, he lowered his weapon to the floor and stepped aside. Then, into his walkie-talkie, he barked, "We need medical personnel to the roof; a wounded man needs immediate aid." He nodded at Dani in acknowledgment.</p>

            <p>The survivors of Dani's group began filing out of the lobby, moving down the hallway toward the stairs. One by one, they ascended the final flight to the roof. Sebastian carried Eddie's pale, still form, Elizabeth following close behind, gently stroking his hair. Tabitha's breath caught. Eddie wasn't moving, and she feared he was already gone.</p>

            <p>At the top of the stairwell, Dani hesitated for a moment before pushing open the door. Bright sunlight flooded the stairwell, forcing many to shield their eyes. But Dani stepped out without hesitation, not even reaching for her umbrella. Timothy, Zahra, Tabitha, and Elizabeth followed her. Sebastian, bearing Eddie's lifeless body, came next, trailed by the remaining fifteen members of the Workers Revolt, including Stephen Webber. Behind him, Abigail Barrett brought up the rear. Tabitha was surprised to see even some of the Orchid Security Forces had come along.</p>

            <p>"Let's raise the flag now," Dani said.</p>

            <p>Zahra pulled a compact metal rod from her pants pocket. She pressed a button, and the rod extended smoothly from half a meter to over four meters. Timothy produced a folded cloth, and together they fastened it to the pole.</p>

            <p>The Workers Revolt members formed a line, Timothy at one end and Dani at the other. The flagpole passed slowly, deliberately, through every hand, a silent vow binding them all. When it reached Sebastian, he gently laid Eddie's body down and rested the pole on his chest for a long, quiet moment. Elizabeth's soft weeping broke the stillness as the blood soaked into the fabric.</p>

            <p>Finally, Sebastian passed the pole to Dani.</p>

            <p>"This moment," she said, voice steady and clear, "is dedicated to every member of the Workers Revolt who has died fighting for freedom, not just here today in Orchid Corp or New York City, but every labor soldier across the United States and the world, past and present. To every union member who was maimed or killed, every laborer, every employee, every serf, every slave who fought and died for labor rights and human dignity, we do this for all of us."</p>

            <p>Dani carried the flag toward a patch of soil and rock in the center of the roof, a patch Tabitha hadn't noticed before but instinctively understood was part of Dani's meticulous planning. Without hesitation, Dani planted the pole firmly in the dirt. The red flag with the raised fist caught the wind, snapping sharply as it unfurled.</p>

            <p>"Look over there," someone whispered.</p>

            <p>Tabitha followed the pointing finger to see similar flags rising on rooftops across the city, one by one flapping in the breeze.</p>

            <p>Dani's gaze swept over the weary group, her comrades, and even the Orchid Security forces who had joined them. Tabitha realized then that when Dani spoke of "all workers," she truly meant everyone.</p>

            <p>"It looks like we did it," Elizabeth said softly. "It looks like we've won."</p>

            <p>Dani smiled at the young woman and said, "No, we've still got a lot of work to do. This is only the start. The oligarchs won't surrender so easily."</p>

            <p>Tabitha's attention drifted as a swell of wonder filled her chest. Looking at all the flags that had been raised on the other buildings, she moved toward the eastern edge of the Orchid Corp building and waved at a fellow soldier on the International Insurance building's roof. Two figures returned the wave.</p>

            <p>Maybe the revolution wasn't won, but the day was. It was won with blood, tears, and sweat. It was won in hope, fear, and desperation. And now it was time to rest; the next step in the Workers' Revolution was waiting.</p>
