November 2, 1920
	The unseasonable warmth clung to Atlanta like a fever on election night. Even with the sun long gone, the air hung thick and still through the barred windows of the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. Eugene Victor Debs sat forward in his chair, every nerve alive with anticipation. The first polls had closed hours ago in the northeastern states, and his jailer, Henry Walsh, had promised to bring him results as they trickled in. It would be agonizingly slow, but Debs had nothing but time stretching before him, and he knew sleep was already lost.
	The common room buzzed with subdued conversation. In minutes, the guards would round them up for final count and lights out, but not yet. Debs found himself wedged between two fellow socialists, both former IWW men from the union he'd helped build. They dissected the election with the fervor of men who had nothing else to occupy their minds.
	"The country's different now, Gene," the first man insisted, his voice carrying that relentless optimism that had probably landed him in here. "You've got a real shot. People are listening."
	His companion, a sharp-featured man whose bluntness had won him few friends even among allies, cut through the hope. "Listening doesn't mean votes. Wilson's still got the machine, and Wood's got the money."
	The exchange sent Debs's emotions careening from hope to despair and back again. Finally, he excused himself and moved to the far side of the room, seeking space to breathe. The smell of disinfectant and unwashed bodies pressed against him, familiar as his own skin after nearly two years in this place.
	Every few moments, his eyes found the clock on the wall. The hands seemed frozen, mocking him. The first polls had closed over an hour ago, but the wait stretched like taffy. Radio stations across the country had promised results faster than ever before, yet "faster than ever before" crawled at a snail's pace when your future hung in the balance.
	Across the room, a man coughed. Debs tensed, the sound triggering reflexive anxiety that still gripped everyone two years after the flu pandemic. Another cough followed, deeper this time. He forced himself to look away, focusing instead on the steady drip from a leak in the ceiling. The water had been falling for days now, each drop landing in the same spot on the concrete floor with metronomic persistence.
	Drip. Drip. Drip. Between the men's voices and that incessant sound, his nerves were fraying like old rope.
	"Alright, men. Fifteen minutes to lights out. Get in line and let's get you all to your cells."
	Debs turned toward the voice. Henry Walsh stood near the doorway, his young face carrying that mixture of authority and uncertainty that marked him as new to the job. The man had struck up an unlikely friendship with Debs, built on arguments that had somehow transformed into mutual respect. Walsh had returned from the European war with his head full of patriotic fervor and contempt for Debs's anti-war stance. But the more they'd sparred over politics and philosophy, the more the young guard had begun to question his own certainties. He still claimed to be a Democrat, still insisted he'd voted for Wilson, but something had shifted in his voice when he spoke to Debs now.
	The prisoners shuffled into formation, Debs taking his customary place at the front. Walsh avoided his eyes at first, then, once everyone had lined up, turned and let something slip from his hand, a small piece of paper that fluttered to the floor like a wounded moth.
	Debs glanced at the men behind him, but no one seemed to have noticed. He bent slowly, his joints protesting after hours of sitting, and palmed the paper, slipping it into his pocket. The folded scrap felt like it carried the weight of the world. His fingers itched to unfold it, but not here, not with so many eyes around.
	The procession through the prison corridors felt endless. Debs kept his right hand buried in his pocket, fingertips working the paper's edges like a rosary bead. One by one, men peeled away to stand at attention before their cells. When Debs reached his own door, he positioned himself and waited. The guards made their return pass, counting heads. A whistle sounded, sharp and final.
	Debs stepped into his cell, and the moment the walls blocked him from view, he yanked the paper from his pocket. His hands trembled as he unfolded it in the dim light filtering through the small window. Walsh's handwriting was his usual scrawl, barely legible even in daylight. Debs squinted at the shadows and made out the words, "Mass to Wilson, VT and NH to Wood."
	The disappointment hit just as the lights clicked off, plunging him into darkness.


	Forty-five minutes later, Debs still perched on the edge of his narrow cot, straining to catch any stray light that might illuminate Walsh's note. He held it up to every angle, hoping the words might have changed. They never did. Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire had not swung to Debs. The disappointment sat in his chest like a cold stone.
	He wanted to crumple the paper and hurl it across the cell, but couldn't bring himself to destroy his only connection to the world beyond these walls, his only link to the election that would determine not just his future, but the future of everything he'd fought for.
	Keys clinked in the corridor. Debs looked up as light from a lantern began to dance on the far wall, shadows shifting like living things. The guard passed his cell without a glance, but his arm moved slightly, and another ball of paper rolled across the floor, coming to rest at Debs's feet.
	When Walsh's footsteps faded into silence, Debs grabbed the paper and unfolded it. The cell remained too dark to read. He bit back a curse and settled in to wait, his patience worn thin.
	Minutes crawled by before the lantern light began to approach again. Debs leaned forward, paper ready. When Walsh reached the cell door, he paused and held his lantern to one side. Light spilled across the page, and Debs's eyes flew over the words: "CT to Wilson, RI to Wood, NY to Debs, 45 EVs."
	His pulse hammered in his throat. New York's forty-five electoral votes had gone to him. He wanted to leap from the bed, to shout until his voice gave out, to dance around his tiny cell like a man possessed. Instead, he sat perfectly still as Walsh continued his rounds and darkness reclaimed the space.
	It didn't matter. The words burned in his memory: "NY to Debs, 45 EVs." He pressed the paper to his lips and whispered the phrase like a prayer. Anyone watching might have thought he'd already won the presidency.


	Walsh made his rounds several more times through the night, each visit following the same careful ritual. A paper would appear, Debs would retrieve it, and position himself for the return pass when the lantern would grant him precious seconds to read.
	"NJ, PA to Debs, ME to Wood"
	"OH, WI, MN to Debs, MI to Wood"
	"IA, IL to Lowden, IN to Debs"
	By midnight, the impossible was crystallizing into reality. Debs ran calculations in his head, trying to track the electoral count. He wasn't certain of every state's value, but he believed he was approaching 150 electoral votes, more than halfway to the 266 needed for victory.
	His heart raced until he feared it might simply burst. He forced himself to take slow, measured breaths, fighting to calm his racing pulse. The breathing exercises felt futile against the adrenaline coursing through his veins, but exhaustion eventually claimed him. He woke to the sound of morning roll call at six o'clock.
	"Oh, my God." The words escaped before he was fully conscious.
	He bolted upright, eyes wide, and spotted several paper balls scattered across his cell floor. He snatched them up, fingers working frantically to unfold each one. The predawn darkness mocked him. He couldn't read a single word.
	The familiar clink of keys approached, but this wouldn't be Walsh now. Debs knew it was probably Smith, the openly Democratic guard who had nonetheless always treated Debs with quiet respect despite their political differences. The sounds grew closer, and Debs moved to his cell door, pressing against the cold bars.
	When Smith appeared, he stopped at Debs's cell and produced his ring of keys. The lock turned with a heavy click, and the door swung open. Smith gestured for Debs to step out for roll call.
	As Debs emerged into the corridor, he noticed the other prisoners who had already been released from their cells. They stood at attention as required, but every pair of eyes was fixed on him. Something had changed in their faces overnight, something electric and expectant.
	Smith stepped forward, extending his hand. His voice carried that thick aristocratic drawl that marked him as old Atlanta money. "Well, good morning, sir. I just wanted to be the first person to shake your hand this morning." He paused, a smile breaking across his weathered face before he emphasized the last two words, "Mr. President."


April 10, 1923
	Charles Farnsworth stood at the edge of Lafayette Square, watching President Debs step up to the makeshift podium. The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly, and sweat had already begun to gather beneath his tailored collar. Around him, the crowd pressed closer, steelworkers still in their work clothes, women from the textile mills, men whose calloused hands told the story of honest labor. They had come straight from their shifts to hear their champion speak, and their excitement was palpable.
	Farnsworth adjusted his position, trying to blend in among people who had never owned a factory, never met a payroll, and never watched two generations of family legacy crumble in just two years. The weight of the revolver inside his coat seemed to grow heavier with each passing moment. He had rehearsed this moment a hundred times in his Chicago mansion, standing before the mirror in his study, drawing and aiming until the motion became automatic.
	Within weeks of Debs taking office, the executive orders had started coming. Every company doing business with the federal government now had to recognize unions, pay prevailing wages, and submit to federal labor inspections. For Farnsworth's steel operation, built on government contracts and non-union labor, the orders were a death sentence delivered with bureaucratic precision. The real devastation came when Debs directed the Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws that previous administrations had conveniently ignored. Federal investigators had crawled through his books, examining price-fixing agreements that had been standard practice for decades.
	Worse still, Debs had used his presidential pardoning power to free dozens of labor organizers imprisoned during the Red Scare. These men had immediately returned to Chicago to organize Farnsworth's workers. What had once been a compliant workforce now demanded eight-hour shifts, safety equipment, and wages that would cut his profit margins to nothing. The federal contracts that had sustained his family's empire for two generations slipped away, awarded instead to companies that met Debs's new labor standards.
	"The time has come," Debs's voice carried across the square, "when the people of this nation will no longer tolerate the few living in splendor while the many live in want!"
	The crowd roared its approval. Farnsworth clenched his jaw. Splendor? He thought of his father, who had worked eighteen-hour days to build their first mill. He thought of his grandfather, who had arrived from England with nothing but ambition and callused hands. Three generations of sacrifice, reduced to "splendor" in the mouth of this Socialist demagogue.
	"We have shown that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth!" Debs continued, his fist raised toward the sky.
	Farnsworth began pushing forward through the crowd. Workers stepped aside, barely giving him a second glance. They were enamored with Debs. His hand moved inside his coat, fingers closing around the familiar grip. After two years of watching everything collapse, two years of seeing his workers - people he had fed and housed and cared for - turn against him at the first whisper from union organizers, two years of federal agents treating him like a criminal for running his business the way it had always been run.
	"The capitalist class has had its day," Debs called out, his voice carrying across the square with absolute conviction. "Now it is our turn!"
	Farnsworth reached the front row. The words hit him like a physical blow. His turn? What about the men who had built America's industrial might? What about the risk-takers and the innovators? What about the families whose fortunes had created jobs for thousands?
	His hand emerged from his coat, the revolver solid and reassuring in his grip. The afternoon sun caught the metal as he raised it toward the platform. Around him, people were still cheering, still hanging on every word from their Socialist messiah.
	"This is for America!" he shouted, his voice barely audible above the crowd's roar.
	The first shot cracked across the square. Debs staggered backward, his hand flying to his chest. Farnsworth fired again, then a third time, watching with grim satisfaction as the president crumpled to the wooden planks. The crowd's cheers transformed into screams, people pushing and shoving in sudden panic.
	A sharp crack echoed from his left. Farnsworth felt something punch him in the chest, spinning him around. The cobblestones rushed up to meet him, and he found himself lying on his back, staring up at the blue April sky. His expensive suit was growing warm and wet beneath him.
	A member of the Civilian Protective Guard stood nearby, smoke still rising from his rifle barrel. Farnsworth tried to speak, to explain that he had saved America from the Socialist menace, but only blood came from his mouth. The faces above him were blurring, voices growing distant.
	At least it was done. Debs would never give another speech about the capitalist class having had its day. As consciousness faded, Charles Farnsworth's last thought was of his grandfather, arriving in America with nothing but hope and determination. Perhaps the old man would understand.
