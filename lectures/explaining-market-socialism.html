          <h1>Market Socialism and Its Future</h1>
          <p><strong>University Lecture by Dr. Naomi Velasquez</strong></p>

        <p>Let’s start by clearing up a common misconception: socialism doesn’t mean the government controls every business or factory. That idea comes from older models, but here in the United States, socialism has taken a different form. Since the early 1920s, after Eugene Debs’s election and the reforms that followed, our economy shifted toward what we now call market socialism.</p>

        <p>In this system, most businesses aren’t owned by private investors or stockholders looking to maximize profits. Instead, they’re worker-run cooperatives. That means the people who actually do the work — the employees — own and manage the company democratically. They share the profits fairly, and decisions are made collectively, not handed down from distant shareholders or corporate executives.</p>

        <p>Yet, this isn’t a pure command economy, like the socialist ideal you might imagine from Marx’s writings. Markets still exist here. Prices still fluctuate based on supply and demand. Companies compete for customers. Advertising is still common. We haven’t abolished money or markets; instead, we’ve reshaped them so that the benefits flow to the workers rather than a small capitalist class.</p>

        <p>This is why we call our system market socialism. It blends social ownership with market mechanisms. Unlike capitalism, where profit often comes from extracting value from workers, here profits stay with the people creating them.</p>

        <p>It’s important to understand this system as a transitional or ‘bridge’ phase, not the final destination. Marx himself suggested that socialism would evolve in stages, moving away from capitalism’s flaws but not instantly abolishing markets or money. What we see today is a practical compromise — a step toward a more equitable society that still uses markets for efficiency and innovation.</p>

        <p>So why move further left now? Why are younger Socialist politicians questioning the sufficiency of market socialism?</p>

        <p>To answer that, we have to look at recent history, especially the early 2010s. Despite decades of relative stability, the United States faced serious challenges. The 2013 economic crash hit hard — triggered by aggressive right-wing policies that deregulated industries and cut social programs, widening inequality and creating new vulnerabilities in the system.</p>

        <p>That crash exposed the limits of market socialism as it was practiced. While worker cooperatives remained the norm, external economic shocks revealed how still connected we were to global capitalism’s instabilities. The social safety nets were strained, and many workers saw their gains threatened.</p>

        <p>Then came the Saavedra Incident in October 2013. This event, which was a direct result of deregulation, further highlighted the grievances many citizens held towards the current American economic model. It brought to light how fragile our economy was and how major damage could be done by one small group of people who thought they knew better. And it caused many people to demand even deeper democratic control and a reconsideration of how the economy worked at its core.</p>

        <p>That moment sparked a resurgence in Socialist Party activism and forced a reckoning. Younger politicians started asking: Is market socialism enough? Or do we need to push toward a system that truly eliminates capitalist structures altogether — a socialism where markets and private property play a much smaller role, if any?</p>

        <p>They’re debating what comes after market socialism. Some argue for expanding democratic planning, where communities and workers coordinate production and distribution more directly. Others call for strengthening public ownership of key sectors, or developing alternative economic models that emphasize sustainability and social welfare over competition.</p>

        <p>This debate is crucial because socialism isn’t a fixed endpoint. It’s a process, always evolving to meet new challenges and opportunities. Market socialism helped us escape the worst abuses of capitalism by shifting ownership to workers and preserving democratic control. But the lessons from the crash and Saavedra Incident remind us that economic systems must keep adapting.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the goal remains to build an economy that serves people — not profits — and empowers individuals and communities to have a real voice in decisions affecting their lives. The shift from market socialism to something deeper isn’t a rejection of what we’ve built, but a natural progression toward fulfilling the promises of socialism more fully.</p>

        <p>So, keep in mind: what we have now is a solid foundation, but the journey is ongoing. The questions young Socialists are asking today — about democracy, ownership, markets, and equity — are where progress lives. The road ahead is uncharted, but it’s one we’re walking with purpose.</p>
