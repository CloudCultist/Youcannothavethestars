      <p>When we talk about diplomacy, we talk about history. Versailles. Camp David. Oslo. We imagine conference rooms, flags, bitter compromises, and carefully worded communiqués. But what happens when the other party across the table isn’t human?</p>

      <p>It may sound like science fiction, but as Secretary of State, I don’t have the luxury of ignoring the improbable. In fact, I’ve come to believe that the improbable is already overdue. If we accept the statistical likelihood that intelligent life exists elsewhere—and many of our brightest minds do—then we must also begin planning for the moment we are no longer alone.</p>

      <p>This isn’t just a thought experiment. It’s a national security imperative.</p>

      <p>So how would diplomacy with a non-human intelligence work? The answer is: we don’t know. But we can prepare.</p>

      <p>First, we must understand that everything we take for granted in diplomacy—emotion, logic, reciprocity, even language—may not apply. Extraterrestrial civilizations might not negotiate over resources or territory. They might not even understand concepts like power, sovereignty, or trust the way we do. If they are older than us, their goals may be unfathomable. If they are younger, they may be volatile.</p>

      <p>Either way, we will need a new kind of diplomat: part linguist, part anthropologist, part philosopher. Someone who can navigate ambiguity, endure uncertainty, and represent humanity not just politically, but ethically.</p>

      <p>Second, any encounter will raise profound questions about representation. Who speaks for Earth? The League of Nations? A coalition of scientific authorities? A single government? These questions are currently theoretical—but one day, they won’t be.</p>

      <p>Third, and most crucially, we must confront the possibility that alien contact will destabilize more than geopolitics. It may shake the foundations of our faith, identity, and sense of control. That’s not a reason to panic—it’s a reason to prepare, with transparency and care.</p>

      <p>To that end, I’ve begun working with international partners, security advisors, and scientific liaisons to draft the first framework for Non-Terrestrial Engagement Protocols. It is early, imperfect work. But it is necessary. We cannot afford to let fear or superstition be our first response.</p>

      <p>If they come—whoever “they” are—they will not just be meeting Americans or Russians or Nigerians. They will be meeting Earth. Our job is to ensure that Earth is ready.</p>

      <p>In the absence of certainty, we choose preparation. In the absence of precedent, we choose principle. That is what diplomacy must become in the 21st century.</p>
