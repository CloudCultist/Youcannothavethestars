        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <p><strong>April 2032</strong></p>
      </header>

<p>Tabitha settled back into the taxi's worn leather seat as they pulled away from her apartment building. The sounds of morning in D.C. drifted through the partially open window: distant traffic, the occasional horn, the familiar sounds of the city starting its day. Traffic was lighter than usual, which meant she'd actually arrive early for once. She pulled out her NASA funding report and spread it across her lap, the pages slightly wrinkled from viewing them repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Revolutionary propulsion systems," she murmured under her breath, testing how the phrase sounded. Not "experimental" or "theoretical," words that made nervous appropriators think of money disappearing into academic black holes. Revolutionary suggested something concrete, something that would change everything.</p>

<p>And it would change everything if the scientists were right. If the research panned out, humanity wouldn't be confined to crawling between planets anymore. They'd have the galaxy itself within reach.</p>

<p>The numbers blurred slightly as she reviewed them for the third time. Five terms in Congress, and she'd never felt this close to something truly historic. The president had given her fifteen minutes for this meeting, and if everything went right, this might finally be her chance to make a real difference, to be remembered for something beyond committee votes and budget line items. Her fingers drummed against the briefcase handle.</p>

<p>The screech of brakes and crunch of metal echoed from the intersection ahead. The taxi driver slammed his brakes, and Tabitha pitched forward as they lurched to a stop just centimeters from the car in front of them, her NASA funding report flying from her lap. Through the windshield, she could see two vehicles twisted together in the intersection, steam rising from a crumpled hood. The driver muttered something sharp under his breath, then caught her eye in the rearview mirror, his face flushing with embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Sorry about the language, ma'am," he said.</p>

<p>Tabitha offered him a quick smile. She'd heard worse in committee hearings. Traffic had already begun backing up behind them. She bit back a curse. "I'm really sorry, but I have an important meeting to get to. I'll just walk from here." She started gathering the scattered NASA documents. "How much is the fare?"</p>

<p>"Three seventy-five," he said, and she pressed her palm against the payment scanner. The little light on the machine turned red as it communicated with her MindBeam, automatically deducting the fare from her checking account. The small light turned green, confirming the transaction.</p>

<p>She finished gathering the scattered pages of her report and tucked them into her briefcase alongside her laptop. When everything was in place, she got out with a "thank you" and closed the door.</p>

<p>Once on the street, Tabitha began weaving her way through the still cars to the sidewalk in front of the National Theatre. As she started toward the White House, the morning air carried the usual D.C. mixture of car exhaust and food truck aromas. She patted her laptop bag at her side, the familiar weight reassuring.</p>

<p>People moved around Tabitha in the typical Washington shuffle. A few faces turned her way with that flicker of recognition she'd grown accustomed to over nearly five terms in Congress. Early on, those looks had thrilled her, a small rush every time she was noticed. Now they barely registered. She kept her pace steady and purposeful.</p>

<p>The walk gave her time to think. The meeting with President Turner wasn't just about NASA funding numbers. It was about positioning, about proving she deserved her role as head of the House Science, Space, and Technology Research Committee. The crash had rattled her, and she wanted to compose herself before entering the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the familiar white columns of the White House came into view. She approached the security checkpoint and told the guard she had an appointment. After presenting her ID and going through a metal detector, she was escorted to the waiting area outside the Oval Office. Her escort left her without a word, and Tabitha walked in.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she said to the young man behind the desk on the other side of the small room. He looked up from his computer screen. Asian, probably mid-twenties, with carefully styled hair and the kind of polished appearance that suggested ambition. As she walked over to the desk, the bronze nameplate caught her attention: "Edward Liu, Secretary to the President." Her own smile flickered. A name like that carried history. Was he related to former President Edward Liu?</p>

<p>"Good morning, ma'am," Edward Liu said, "Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I have an 11:15 meeting with President Turner. I'm Congresswoman Tabitha Bosanac."</p>

<p>Edward looked at his computer for a second and nodded. "Yep, the NASA meeting. I see it. Have a seat, and he'll be with you shortly." He motioned to a white and blue striped couch behind her.</p>

<p>Tabitha nodded and sat on the couch. Once she was comfortable, she pulled out her MindBeam Glass, the translucent, handheld device familiar in her palm. She was reviewing her talking points when the display suddenly went dark. Then neon green numbers appeared: "60:00."</p>

<p>The countdown began.</p>

<p>59:59.</p>

<p>59:58.</p>

<p>59:57.</p>

<p>Tabitha frowned at the device. This wasn't normal. She started tapping on the display, but nothing was happening. It was completely frozen. She looked up to see Edward staring at his computer screen with the same bewildered expression.</p>

<p>"What just happened?" he said and started typing rapidly on his keyboard before throwing his hands up in frustration.</p>

<p>"Something weird happened here, too. My MindBeam just started counting down."</p>

<p>Edward looked at her and said, "These weird green numbers?" He swiveled his monitor around, and she stood to look. Sure enough, the same countdown from her MindBeam was also on his computer screen.</p>

<p>"What do you think it means?" she asked. He shook his head and started punching keys on his keyboard again, with the same result.</p>

<p>As the countdown hit 58:00, hurried footsteps echoed from the hallway. Tabitha and Edward looked up. Two Secret Service agents rounded the corner, followed by a woman Tabitha recognized: Secretary of State Jessica Baldwin. A lock of dark hair had slipped loose from her carefully styled hair, and her face was flushed. Her breathing was quick, her eyes sharp and focused. Tabitha stepped aside as the three passed without so much as a glance in her direction.</p>

<p>Without even a knock on the Oval Office door, they opened it and went inside. Looking past them, Tabitha saw President Turner look up from his desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," the agent's voice carried clearly into the waiting area. "We need you to come with us right now." The president sprang up and joined the trio at the door. They spoke for a few moments and then started walking towards the lobby where Eddie and Tabitha were standing. As they got closer, Tabitha heard him ask, "Every device?"</p>

<p>Baldwin touched her temple, activating the MindBeam nestled just beneath her skin. The technology interfaced directly with her nervous system, and Tabitha saw the back of Baldwin's hand begin to glow, green numbers ticking down in steady succession. Tabitha hadn't even thought of looking at her own hand. She mimicked Baldwin, and the same green numbers appeared on hers as well.</p>

<p>56:44.</p>

<p>56:43.</p>

<p>56:42.</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Edward do the same.</p>

<p>"Oh, congresswoman," a voice said.</p>

<p>Tabitha looked up as Turner, Baldwin, and the agents approached her, her eyes wide at the president addressing her. The agents slowed for a brief second, and Turner touched her arm and nodded his head, which she took as permission to walk with him. Secretary Baldwin looked at her for a brief second but didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Without breaking stride, one of the agents continued where he had left off. "Sir, we still don't know what happens at zero. Could be nothing, could be an attack, but we're not taking chances."</p>

<p>As Tabitha walked behind the group through the halls of the White House, she wasn't sure if she should speak or stay silent. She'd never been part of anything like this before.</p>

<p>They passed several small groups of people, their conversations hushed but urgent. As they walked past a small room on the left, she could hear a cold, inhuman voice coming from a dusty old stereo, which looked like it had been untouched for decades.</p>

<p>"Fifty-one, thirty-six. Fifty-one, thirty-five. Fifty-one, thirty-four."</p>

<p>A chill ran down Bosanac's spine. That mechanical, utterly indifferent voice was even more unsettling than the green numbers glowing on the back of her hand.</p>

<p>As if taking his cue from the voice on the radio, Turner turned to Baldwin. "Can you hear it? Through your MindBeam?" As someone who had famously decided against getting the implant, he wouldn't know.</p>

<p>She nodded, her jaw tight. "Yeah. But I shut it off. Thank gods for small mercies."</p>

<p>Curious, Tabitha touched the MindBeam activation on the side of her temple and, to her surprise, she heard the same countdown as the one on the radio. From in front of her, she heard Baldwin mutter, "I'll be sending Orchid Group a long letter about their 'hack-proof' device."</p>

<p>Turner frowned. "The MindBeam's never been compromised before. Whoever did this has serious resources." He turned and looked at Bosanac. "I assume you can hear it, too, Congresswoman?"</p>

<p>Caught off guard at the sudden question, Tabitha nodded. "Yes, sir. I just tried it and I can hear it in my head, too." When she said it, she could tell the president didn't like the answer. His lips were pressed together, the worry lines on his face obvious.</p>

<p>Turner and Baldwin kept up a hurried, uneasy conversation as the group reached the library in the east end of the White House. The space smelled faintly of old books and furniture polish. Tabitha had been in this room before during previous visits to the White House and couldn't imagine what they were doing there now.</p>

<p>"Maybe the congresswoman shouldn't be here," one of the agents said when they stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"She's a member of the Science and Tech committee. I think she might have some valuable input," Turner replied. He turned back and glanced at Tabitha. She thought about telling him she wasn't a scientist, that her job was to throw funding at what other people told her was important, but she kept her mouth shut.</p>

<p>The agent decided not to argue but warned, "When this is over, we're confident you will keep quiet about where you've been." She nodded, although she was watching the other agent walk to the far wall, where he pressed a small indentation embedded in a tall brown bookcase. A small panel slid open with barely a whisper, revealing a hidden security array complete with a keyhole, number pad, retina, and fingerprint scanner. Tabitha's eyes went wide at the sight.</p>

<p>Once the security panel was exposed, Turner fished out a key and inserted it, punched in a six-digit code, pressed his thumb to the scanner, and leaned in for the retinal scan. Each step looked rehearsed and mechanical, as if he had been preparing for this moment for a long time. After he had gone through the entire process, the bookcase moved with surprising smoothness, revealing a steel staircase spiraling down into darkness.</p>

<p>One of the Secret Service agents led the way, overhead lights coming on in sequence as the group began their descent. The air grew cooler with each step, carrying the sterile scent of recycled atmosphere. Tabitha thought about her small staff and hoped they were safe. She thought about her mother down in Florida and wondered if this was affecting her. Slowly, the full immensity of what was happening was settling, and she was beginning to understand this might be the biggest crisis of her lifetime.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the staircase, an elevator waited, its brushed metal doors gleaming under the fluorescent lights. The five of them piled in and, once the doors closed, descended even deeper underground. Tabitha leaned back, hands behind her on the railing. She closed her eyes, trying to fight off the sense of being completely overwhelmed. When she woke up this morning, she never would have believed she'd be riding a secret elevator under the White House with the president. It was beginning to be too much to take.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath and opened her eyes. Whatever was happening, she was part of it now. She counted down from ten, and by the time the doors opened, she had forced herself to be ready to face whatever this was.</p>

<p>The agents led the three of them through a set of double doors into a conference room. The room had a long wooden table in the middle, with a dozen seats around it. More rolling chairs were set against one wall, while on another was a giant television screen. The walls themselves were painted a relaxing blue, and the thick walls and controlled environment allowed her to stop worrying about herself and focus on the situation.</p>

<p>Once in the room, Turner sat in a chair at the end of the table opposite the television screen while Baldwin took a chair on his left, facing the door. One of the agents went to a phone on a wall to Tabitha's right while the other walked through a door to the left of the television and turned on a light, then closed the door.</p>

<p>"Tabitha, please take a seat," President Turner told her, pointing to the chair closest to her, directly across from Jessica Baldwin.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Tabitha said, sitting where she was told. It was then she realized she had left her bag with the NASA paperwork and her laptop in the waiting area outside the Oval Office. The funding meeting that had seemed so important an hour ago now felt like it belonged to a different world.</p>

<hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">

<p>Over the next forty-five minutes, Turner, Baldwin, and Tabitha discussed what they'd witnessed, but with no real information beyond the countdown itself, it was all speculation. When several cabinet appointees arrived â€“ including the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Domestic Security, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff â€“ they brought no additional intelligence, just the same questions everyone else was asking. The Vice Chairman was being followed by a woman in an Army uniform with the silver eagle insignia, which identified her as a colonel.</p>

<p>When the other cabinet members started arriving, the three of them had talked around their biggest fear, that this was some kind of prelude to an attack. The thought made Tabitha's stomach clench. But underneath her terror was something else she barely wanted to acknowledge â€“ a guilty thrill that she was here, witnessing something that could reshape everything.</p>

<p>Each of the newcomers chose a chair around the table and settled in. With all of the new people, the space felt both cavernous and claustrophobic to Tabitha. She kept trying to focus on anything except the massive television screen, which had been turned on and was now showing the same relentless countdown that had illuminated her hand.</p>

<p>11:52.</p>

<p>11:51.</p>

<p>11:50.</p>

<p>The Vice Chairman, General Harrison Collins, his weathered face grim, held up the receiver of the phone in front of him, which had been inside the table until he pushed a button, and it appeared. "The Countdowns on every line, sir," he said. "Calls work, but when the line's open, you hear the numbers." He pressed the speaker button, and the same lifeless voice from the old stereo filled the room.</p>

<p>"Eleven minutes, thirty-three. Eleven minutes, thirty-two. Eleven minutes, thirty-one."</p>

<p>Each second stretched endlessly as the countdown approached zero. Tabitha's palms grew damp against the table's surface, and she found herself holding her breath. She kept having to remind herself to breathe.</p>

<p>The room felt charged, like the moments before a thunderstorm. A red phone mounted on the far wall buzzed sharply, making her jump. She looked around quickly, grateful no one appeared to have noticed. General Collins rose and crossed the room, his boots clicking against the polished floor. He lifted the receiver and said nothing at first, only listened to the voice on the other end, his face still and unreadable. After a few moments, he said, "Understood," hung up, and addressed the room. "We're escalating to DEFCON 3."</p>

<p>A few people around the table stiffened, but no one spoke, except the Secretary of Domestic Security, Eric Parsons, who whispered one word. "Jesus."</p>

<p>President Turner leaned forward, his hands resting on the table. "Who made the call?"</p>

<p>"Joint Chiefs just confirmed it with STRATCOM and NORAD. No sign of a launch, but with this level of technological compromise, we're not assuming anything. The entire Armed Forces are being prepped for rapid deployment, and the Air Force is already on alert."</p>

<p>Jessica Baldwin's eyes narrowed. "So, we're treating this as a prelude to an attack?"</p>

<p>"No one's saying that yet," Collins replied evenly. "But we're done waiting around. Cyber Command is mobilizing. FAA's been notified. Presidential communications are being hardened, and we're locking down D.C. airspace." He turned to Turner. "Sir, per protocol, we recommend you prepare for possible relocation to another secure location."</p>

<p>Turner shook his head. "Not until we know what we're dealing with. I'm staying in this bunker until the countdown ends, or someone gives me a reason to run."</p>

<p>Collins didn't argue. He just nodded and returned to his seat, crossing his arms as the countdown ticked away on the screen. Tabitha found herself wondering why he had given up so quickly.</p>

<p>When the countdown reached the last ten seconds, her heart hammered against her ribs, her hands gripping the table until her knuckles turned white. What if this were an attack? What if people back home were panicking while she sat safely underground? The guilt mixed with her terror as the seconds ticked away. All she could hear was the blood rushing in her ears, drowning out even that mechanical voice that had haunted her mind for the past hour.</p>

<p>0:05; Her hands gripped the table edge.</p>

<p>0:04; A bead of sweat traced her temple.</p>

<p>0:03; Her heart pounded.</p>

<p>0:02; No one moved.</p>

<p>0:01; Her breath caught.</p>

<p>0:00; Tabitha closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. When she opened her eyes, she saw that the green numbers on the television had vanished. The screen was filled with a silent, slowly spinning Earth, bathed in familiar blues and browns, serene and detached. No voice, no music, just the planet, alone in the dark.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, an American-accented voice broke the silence. "To believe we are alone in this vast universe simply reflects the arrogance we humans so often display."</p>

<p>Eric Parsons whipped his head around. "Who is that? Anyone recognize the voice?" He looked at each person in turn, including Tabitha, who shook her head. Almost everyone else at the table had ignored him, eyes glued to the spinning earth.</p>

<p>The view began to pan outward, past Mars, Jupiter, and the other planets. Then another bright gas giant came into view for a fleeting second, and then the scene moved past it. Turner sat up straighter in his chair but said nothing, and the planet vanished, the image rushing past the edge of the solar system.</p>

<p>"What goddamn planet was that?" Baldwin said, her voice sharp with disbelief. "Is this some kind of joke?"</p>

<p>The camera pulled further back, the entire Milky Way now visible, the sun a tiny orange speck at the end of one of the spiral arms. Finally, the image stopped when the whole galaxy filled the screen, its spiral arms stretched across the darkness like ancient calligraphy.</p>

<p>A second voice with a Russian accent, calm and thoughtful, spoke. "All the time I was up there, I never saw anything alien. But I still believe they exist. Much like one of the faithful pronouncing their faith in God, it seems to me to be the only logical position."</p>

<p>As he finished, star after star lit up orange, twenty-four in all, scattered across the galaxy like jewels on black velvet.</p>

<p>A third voice began to speak, softer than the others, with an uncanny cadence that seemed to bypass Tabitha's ear and resonate directly in her mind. "They're right. You are not alone."</p>

<p>As the voice spoke, the Milky Way faded, giving way to a being unlike anything she had ever imagined outside of a science fiction novel. Its skin was a pale, nearly translucent pink, and four eyes stared out from its face: two at the front, glowing green like phosphorescent pools, and two set further back, glossy and black as polished obsidian. Something in its gaze made Tabitha's skin prickle, as if it could actually see her through the screen. There was nothing that resembled a nose, with the only other discernible feature on its face being a small slit-like orifice, which must have been a mouth. The "mouth" wasn't moving as the creature spoke.</p>

<p>Silence held the room while everyone stared at the eerie creature, the Army colonel with her mouth hanging open. Behind her, the air conditioner turned on, bathing her in cold air. She hadn't noticed the sweat prickling on her skin.</p>

<p>Although the creature's mouth didn't move, the voice came through clearly, resonating with that same unsettling quality. "My name is Tru-Urth, and I am from a species that calls itself Ru-Lima. We apologize for the theatrics, but we only wanted to ensure you would listen. This is not a prank, though we are sure many around the world will understandably assume it is. We are real, and we mean you no harm. We cannot stress that enough."</p>

<p>General Collins shot a glance at Turner, his voice full of barely controlled skepticism. "This has got to be some kind of joke. It's absurd."</p>

<p>No one replied, their attention staying firmly on the creature on the screen. The alien's face remained unreadable as it continued, "While we know that many of you will remain skeptical, we assure you, this is not a deception. We are one of several technologically advanced, sentient species in the galaxy. While we are aware you have already discovered simple microbial life on several moons orbiting planets around your own star, today, you have your answer on whether advanced life exists beyond your solar system. My race, along with several other sentient peoples, has spent thousands of years helping one another, trading with one another, and teaching one another."</p>

<p>Collins opened his mouth to say something, probably to express further disbelief, but nothing came out. Tabitha began to find herself annoyed with the man, and she wondered how someone with his temperament had been promoted to general. She let the thought pass as the Ru-Lima continued speaking.</p>

<p>"Even now, several of our vessels are traveling toward your world and, in a few of your months, we will reach your solar system. We sincerely hope that when we arrive, you will welcome us, not with fear, but with the same sense of curiosity and wonder that has driven your own people to look up to the stars. We are eager to meet you, to learn from you, and to share what we can. This moment is as extraordinary for us as it is for you."</p>

<p>For several more minutes, the Ru-Lima spoke, reassuring, explaining, promising peace, its voice maintaining that hypnotic quality that Tabitha found reached past rational thought. As she listened, a strange realization crept over her: she was witnessing humanity's first contact with an alien species. Whatever happened next, this moment would define the rest of human history. Finally, the screen went dark.</p>

<p>Eric Parsons found his voice first. "We don't actually believe this is real, right?" He made eye contact with the president, and Tabitha saw a mixture of skepticism and terror in his face.</p>

<p>Turner shook his head slowly. "Eric, I can't say for certain. But you saw the scale, what they did. The power behind this is staggering. What else could explain it?"</p>

<p>Parsons looked lost, like a man whose fundamental understanding of the world had just been shaken. Shaking his head, he said, "It's a prank. The Indians, maybe the Brazilians..." He trailed off, letting the thought finish itself, though he seemed to know how inadequate the explanation was.</p>

<p>Jessica Baldwin broke in. "Mr. President, we can't jump to any conclusions. We can't know the size or scope of these, these, um, Lima broadcasts at this moment."</p>

<p>"We may not know how far-reaching they were, but we know the people behind this are very powerful. They hacked MindBeam's, for gods' sakes," Collins argued, his voice rising slightly.</p>

<p>Turner's gaze swept the room, and he put his hand up before the discussion could escalate further. "Listen, everyone, we all have work to do. We need to reach out to other world leaders, learn if this was local to the United States or international. If it was international, we need to know how other nations are reacting to it. But first, I'm going to call my wife." Tabitha watched him lean forward and reach out his hand to General Collins, who slid the red phone over to him.</p>

<p>As Turner dialed, she looked over at Jessica Baldwin, who caught her eye. The Secretary of State looked just as worried as Tabitha felt.</p>
