        <h1>Privacy Must Not Become a Shield for Danger</h1>
        <h3>By J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation</h3>

      <p>The proposed 22nd Amendment, currently under consideration in Congress, represents a well-intentioned but deeply flawed approach to safeguarding privacy. While Americans rightly value their personal freedoms, we must not allow the laudable goal of privacy to undermine the very protections that keep our nation safe.</p>

      <p>The amendment’s draft text, which seeks to forbid government surveillance without explicit consent or a warrant, may appear to champion liberty, but it risks placing citizens in greater peril. In an era when subversive ideologies and espionage networks continue to operate both within and beyond our borders, restricting the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor threats in real time could prove catastrophic.</p>

      <p>During the Second World War, federal agencies, including the FBI, acted decisively to identify spies, saboteurs, and collaborators whose actions threatened the lives and liberties of millions of Americans. These measures, often carried out in secrecy, were essential to national security. Now, faced with legislation that would codify sweeping limitations on surveillance, we risk losing the tools that have historically protected our democracy.</p>

      <p>The 22nd Amendment, as currently written, grants potential criminals, foreign agents, and subversives a legal shield to exploit. Requiring “informed, voluntary consent” before monitoring communications is not merely a bureaucratic formality; it creates a legal barrier that could slow or entirely prevent timely investigations. In matters of national defense and counterintelligence, delay can mean disaster.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the amendment mandates that all waivers of privacy rights terminate immediately upon the conclusion of employment or program participation. While this provision may appear fair, it fails to account for lingering security concerns. Threats do not vanish simply because an individual no longer holds a government position; former employees can possess sensitive information whose misuse could endanger the public.</p>

      <p>I am not opposed to privacy as a principle. Responsible oversight, clear legal standards, and transparent procedures are vital to maintaining public trust. But constitutionalizing such broad restrictions at this moment risks handcuffing the very agencies entrusted with protecting the citizenry. Liberty and security are not mutually exclusive, but they must be balanced carefully.</p>

      <p>I urge lawmakers to reconsider the 22nd Amendment in its current form. It is imperative that we safeguard personal freedoms without compromising our ability to confront espionage, subversion, and other threats. In the name of public safety, the amendment should be revised to ensure that privacy protections do not inadvertently place the nation, and its people, at risk.</p>

      <p>America can preserve both liberty and security, but only if we approach reform with prudence rather than zealotry. Let us not allow the promise of privacy to become a refuge for those who would do us harm.</p>
