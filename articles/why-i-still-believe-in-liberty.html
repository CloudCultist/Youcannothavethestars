        <h1>Why I Still Believe in Liberty</h1>
        <h3>By Dr. Oscar Newbury, Professor of Economics, UC Berkeley</h3>
      </header>

      <p>I was thirty-two when Edward Liu was elected president. I cast my ballot for him proudly, and I’d do it again. For a brief moment, America remembered what liberty actually meant: lean government, personal responsibility, and a return to common sense economics.</p>

      <p>Critics call me delusional. They say the Liberty Party died in the fallout of the Great Recession and the Saavedra Incident. But I reject this revisionist history—and I reject the idea that one tragic event, no matter how severe, erases the foundational principles of our movement.</p>

      <p>Let’s talk about what really happened. The Great Recession didn’t begin with Liberty policy—it began with unsustainable entitlements, overextended regulatory agencies, and decades of bipartisan complacency. We merely pulled back the curtain. And as for the Saavedra Incident? That wasn’t a failure of ideology—it was a failure of execution. A private contractor cut corners, yes. But what about the Democratic-majority Congress that refused to fund proper oversight? What about the career bureaucrats who sat on their hands for years, never raising a flag?</p>

      <p>Where were the watchdogs? Where was the media? The Liberty administration was trying to solve a decades-old problem that no one else had the political will to touch. We moved fast because delay meant decay. Did we misplace our trust in private industry? Perhaps. But what, I ask, would have been the alternative? Another bloated federal project doomed to stall in committee?</p>

      <p>Liberty was never about blind trust—it was about unleashing innovation. The idea that the entire philosophy should be discarded because one company—out of thousands—made fatal errors is nothing short of opportunistic scapegoating.</p>

      <p>I remain a Liberty man because I still believe in individual choice, market dynamism, and restraint in government. The Socialist wave that followed Saavedra is emotional, not rational—born of fear, not fact. It is easy to promise safety in exchange for control. It is harder to preserve freedom in the face of panic.</p>

      <p>So yes, I still believe in Liberty. I believe in its ideals, even when others mock them. And I’ll keep fighting to remind this country what it looks like to stand on principle—even when the winds blow in the opposite direction.</p>
