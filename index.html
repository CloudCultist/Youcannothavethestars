        <h2>The World</h2>
        <p>The story unfolds in a familiar yet fundamentally altered timeline, where the 20th century took a divergent path. A different election in 1920 catalyzed a sweeping transformation of the United States. Over the next century, the U.S. led advancements in medicine, environmental stewardship, worker rights, and technological development, becoming a beacon of progress.</p>

        <p>By the 2030s, the world is thriving. Nations cooperate on global challenges, citizens enjoy security and opportunity, and politics largely works in service of the people. New technologies emerge steadily, enhancing understanding, collaboration, and everyday life. Scientists and governments explore these innovations with care, expanding human potential while respecting the foundations of identity, privacy, and stability.</p>

        <p>Then, contact is made.</p>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p><em>You Cannot Have the Stars</em> weaves together the personal stories of eight central characters as they navigate the aftermath of first contact with a highly advanced alien civilization. It is a story of power, trauma, trust, betrayal, and hope.</p>

        <p>This is not just a story about aliens. It's a story about how we define ourselves in the face of the unknown, and what we're willing to sacrifice to preserve our place in the universe.</p>
