          From 1940 to 1960, America navigated the trials of global war, postwar reconstruction, and domestic transformation while preserving its cooperative-democratic identity. Under Presidents Hull, Eisenhower, and Wallace, the nation resisted nuclear annihilation, expanded civil rights, and enacted constitutional reforms, including the landmark Privacy Rights Amendment. By decade’s end, America stood as a moral leader and scientific innovator, poised to enter the space age in partnership with its allies.
