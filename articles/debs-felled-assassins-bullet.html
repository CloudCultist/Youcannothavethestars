        <h2>PRESIDENT DEBS FELLED BY ASSASSIN’S BULLET</h2>
        <h3>Seymour Stedman Now Is Nation’s Chief</h3>
      </header>

      <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 2 —</strong> Eugene Victor Debs, the 28th President of the United States and the first elected on the Socialist Party ticket, was struck down by an assassin’s bullet earlier this afternoon while addressing a labor gathering at Lafayette Square. He was taken to Freedman’s Hospital. He was 67.</p>

      <p>Vice President Seymour Stedman, a longtime confidant of the fallen leader, was sworn in as President in a solemn ceremony at the Capitol later that afternoon.</p>

      <p>The assassin, identified by federal officials only as a Chicago financier with known ties to anti-labor organizations, was shot dead on the scene by a member of the Civilian Protective Guard.</p>

      <p>Witnesses report the gunman approached the president from the crowd, drew a concealed revolver, and fired three shots at close range. Authorities have not yet confirmed whether the attack was part of a broader conspiracy.</p>

      <p>Crowds have already begun to gather outside the White House gates, singing union hymns and clutching portraits of the fallen leader. In New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and a dozen other cities, the news has seemed to stop pedestrians in the streets. Across the industrial heartland, factory whistles sounded at the news.</p>

      <p>Mr. Stedman, in brief remarks from the Capitol steps, called the assassination “an act not just against one man, but against every workingman and woman in this country.” He vowed that the administration “shall not falter nor retreat.”</p>

      <p>President Debs, a four-time presidential candidate and revered orator of the labor movement, took office in March 1921 after a stunning upset in the 1920 election. Running on a platform of worker’s rights, public ownership of key industries, and universal social welfare, the Debs-Stedman ticket triumphed over a splintered opposition and carried 28 states with a total of 277 electoral votes. Dismissed by his critics as an idealist and a radical, Debs nonetheless became a figure of national admiration, even among skeptics, for his decency, resolve, and plainspoken appeals to justice.</p>

      <p>Hampered in his first year by a hostile Congress, Debs toured the nation relentlessly in 1922, urging voters to elect more Socialists. The Socialist Party gained over seventy seats in the House and a historic fifteen in the Senate, allowing the 68th Congress to pass sweeping reforms, including the Federal Labor Act, the National Ownership of Railways Initiative, the Public Utilities Nationalization Act and the American Labor Standards Code.</p>

      <p>But the backlash from entrenched business interests was fierce. Though unnamed in official statements, several administration figures have long warned of threats from powerful industrialists and financiers unhappy with the loss of their influence. Treasury Secretary Morris Hillquit, speaking late last night, hinted that “this was not the work of a madman, but of a class that refuses to yield to democracy.”</p>

      <p>The President’s remains will lie in state beginning tomorrow at the Capitol Rotunda, where thousands are expected to pay their respects. Funeral arrangements are forthcoming.</p>
