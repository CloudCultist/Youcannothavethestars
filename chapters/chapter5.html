            <p>Elizabeth Serrano glanced at her phone again, watching the numbers change from 11:59 to 12:00. Once the day changed from Saturday to Sunday, from the day of the unsettling alien message to the day after, she was able to relax. The Ru-Lima announcement had left her convinced something terrible would happen before the day was over, an unshakeable dread that had kept her adrenaline high. Now that midnight had come and gone and the world still stood, all of that fear and anxiety had dissolved into nothing.</p>

            <p>What remained was disappointment, not that everything was fine, but that she had allowed her fear to drive her into accepting Kent's invitation to this rundown Phoenix bar. She'd initially planned to wait at Danny's place while Kent played his set at the venue, but the fear of being by herself in a strange house in an unknown city changed her mind. They were far from their Texas homes, fifteen hours of desert scrubland behind them, all because Kent's friend had promised a "real crowd" and "decent money."</p>

            <p>The Rusty Cactus sat wedged between a repair shop and a Korean restaurant, its neon sign flickering in the desert heat. Inside, the air was thick with stale beer and cigarette smoke. She had allowed herself to give in again and accepted every drink Kent offered her at one of the mismatched tables scarred with cigarette burns. She knew she was drinking more than she should have, but the alcohol was helping her calm down, and that was what she needed more than anything.</p>

            <p>Then, when she had just gotten tipsy enough that her judgment wasn't fully intact, almost as if it was planned, Kent had pulled her close and kissed her. Passion had overtaken her then, and Kent asked the question he had posed more times than she could count: Do you want to move in together? Even she was surprised when she said yes.</p>

            <p>Kent Manigold, with his overwhelming mix of confidence and charisma, towered over Elizabeth's five-foot-four frame. When he looked at her with those knowing eyes, she felt like the only person in the room, even when they were surrounded by people. They had been together for over two years now, and Elizabeth was convinced she loved him, despite their age difference. At forty-five, Kent had perfected his unique form of seduction and manipulation, sharpened until he could detect even the slightest hint of low self-esteem in a woman. Elizabeth, twenty-six now but still carrying traces of the idealistic girl who had met him at twenty-four, thought she had him figured out. She believed, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that she could purge the parts of Kent that she didn't like, leaving only the things that made her adore him.</p>

            <p>Now, sitting alone at her table and listening to the people around her, she realized the alien broadcast had everyone on edge. At five minutes until midnight, the bartender had put the last five minutes of the countdown back on the TV, and the crowd had chanted the last ten seconds until it hit zero, the bar erupting into cheers as the glowing 00:00 disappeared and the image of the earth took its place. Now, people were buying rounds, laughing louder, as if celebrating their continued existence.</p>

            <p>When the countdown started, Kent took that as his cue to take a break, which was when he asked her to move with him. He had taken another drink to celebrate and then, a few minutes after midnight, he had climbed up on the stage again to play his last three songs.</p>

            <p>When Kent stepped back toward the stage, his fingers brushing the strings of his acoustic guitar, Elizabeth felt that familiar mix of pride and unease. He was good at this part, the performance, making people believe in him for the length of a song. Three songs left, he'd told her earlier, then he would drink, laugh, and carry her back to his friend's place.</p>

            <p>When he got to the last song, he introduced it in a way he had never done before. "This next one goes out to all the men who know what it's like to love a crazy woman." He smiled as if he had made a joke that had the crowd roaring with laughter. Elizabeth felt heat rise to her cheeks out of embarrassment that he couldn't seem to read the room.</p>

            <p>His final song was the usual closer: "Hellish Wife, Hellish Life," a bitter anthem to his ex. Elizabeth had heard it dozens of times, but tonight something about it bothered her more than usual. The lyrics were cruel, reducing his former marriage to a series of complaints and blame. She watched the faces in the crowd, many looking uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>As he sang, Elizabeth felt the alcohol take over. The room spun gently, and her eyelids grew heavy. The last thing she remembered clearly was the applause, scattered and polite, and Kent's satisfied grin as he took a bow. When she opened her eyes again, her cheek was pressed against the sticky wood of the table, and Kent's voice was drifting over from the bar, speaking broken Spanish to the bartender.</p>

            <p>"Amigo, uno cerveza, por favor." His southern-accented Spanish made her wince. She kept her head down, her mind still foggy from the alcohol and fatigue. She fell asleep again.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">
          
            <p>"Ma'am, wake up." A firm hand was shaking Elizabeth's shoulder. She bolted upright and looked around, disoriented for a moment. After a few seconds, she realized where she was: The Rusty Cactus. The bar was empty of everything now except crumpled napkins and half-empty glasses. The smell of alcohol was strong, a pungent reminder of the night's crowd.</p>

            <p>Elizabeth put her hand on her forehead. "What time is it?"</p>
            <p>"2:05 in the morning," the bartender replied. "Bar's closed. You're the last one here."</p>

            <p>Her heart skipped a beat, and Elizabeth reached into her purse for her cell phone, checking to confirm the bartender was telling the truth. When she pushed the button to turn on the screen, the phone proved he hadn't lied. She took a deep breath and pushed hair from her face, fighting the woozy tilt of the room. "Where's Kent?"</p>

            <p>"You mean that godawful singer from earlier? The Backroad Hillbilly?" He said it with a sneer in his voice, his lip curling with disgust.</p>

            <p>"He isn't that bad," Elizabeth said automatically, though even she heard the hollowness in her voice. Deep down, she knew Kent was terrible.</p>

            <p>The bartender ignored her halfhearted defense. "He left. With Lola Hart." The words came out of his mouth like he was reciting a useless trivia fact, but the words hit her like a physical blow nonetheless.</p>

            <p>"Lola?" What kind of name was Lola?</p>

            <p>"Yeah, she's here every time a new band plays. Always tries to fuck the lead singer, just in case they get famous. Wants to be able to say she knew 'em real personal before they made it big." He smiled then and added, "Though we know she doesn't have to worry about that with The Backroad Hillbilly, huh?"</p>

            <p>Elizabeth's hands trembled. She reached for her purse, too drunk to argue. She rose unsteadily and made her way to the door, even though the bartender hadn't actually kicked her out. The bartender followed her to the door and unlocked it for her, the deadbolt clicking loudly in the empty space. "Listen," he said, softening slightly, "you deserve better than that man."</p>

            <p>She murmured a quiet thanks and stepped into the desert night. It was colder than she expected. The door swung shut behind her, and she heard it lock.</p>

            <p>After standing there for a bit, Elizabeth looked out at the parking lot. Her heart sank. It was empty, even of her own vehicle.</p>

            <p>Unwilling to believe Kent would sink that low, she dug in her purse for her car keys, fingers moving frantically. Under the yellow glow of a streetlamp, she emptied her purse onto the cracked concrete. There was her phone, lipstick, wallet, even a stick of gum, but no keys.</p>

            <p>She picked up her phone, hands trembling as she typed out a quick message to Kent. She hit send and waited, the phone heavy in her hands. When ten minutes passed with no reply, she tried calling; it rang once and went to voicemail. He had either put his phone on "Do Not Disturb" or he was actively ignoring her. Panic and disorientation washed over her.</p>

            <p>Hopeless and depressed, Elizabeth walked to the store front and sat down with her back to the brick wall, rough stone biting into her shirt. She sat there, numb, watching occasional cars drift past. Exhaustion won eventually, and her head lolled against the wall. Sleep took her where she sat.</p>
           
            <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">
            
            <p>The first pale streaks of sunrise painted soft pinks and oranges across the sky. To Elizabeth, curled on the concrete against the wall, the colors felt cruelly beautiful, and she almost forgot where she was and why she was here. Her back ached from sleeping against the brick wall, and her mouth tasted like stale beer and regret. The parking lot was empty except for broken glass and cigarette butts, evidence of last night's chaos.</p>

            <p>She wondered what had woken her up, and she heard it again – gravel crunched under tires. A car was pulling into the lot. When she opened her eyes and looked, she saw it was her car, Kent visible behind the wheel.</p>

            <p>For a moment, weary relief stirred in her chest, almost enough to make her smile. Then memory surged back in brutal clarity: the bar, Kent's disappearance, the empty parking space where her Honda should have been. Her mouth went dry, and her stomach twisted in rage.</p>

            <p>Kent parked the car next to where she was sitting and stepped out, stretching like he'd merely finished a pleasant nap somewhere comfortable. His shirt was wrinkled, his hair messed in a way that suggested hands other than his own had been running through it. His face carried a faint wariness, the look of a man aware he'd crossed a line yet still believing his charm could erase it. He'd done this before, Elizabeth realized. Maybe not exactly this, but something close enough that he had a strategy for it.</p>

            <p>"Babe," he said, voice warm, hand extended like he was offering assistance after a minor stumble. "Let me help you up."</p>

            <p>Elizabeth rose on her own, brushing dust and gravel from her jeans. When he stopped in front of her, she met his gaze, voice steady despite the tremor she felt in her chest. "You left me."</p>

            <p>The words carried more weight than if she'd screamed them. Kent's grin faltered for just a moment, a crack in his confident facade, before sliding back into place.</p>

            <p>"C'mon, don't be dramatic. I was just – "</p>

            <p>"You took my keys." She didn't want to hear it. Usually, she wouldn't have interrupted Kent, but now she didn't care. "You took my car. You left me passed out drunk in a bar with a stranger in a city I didn't know and left with a woman you'd just met."</p>

            <p>"Elizabeth, listen – "</p>

            <p>"No." The word cut through his charm like a blade. "I'm done listening." She walked past him toward the car, her footsteps steady on the gravel despite the way her legs wanted to shake. Kent turned, staring after her with something that might have been genuine surprise. In all their fights, all their arguments, she'd never walked away from him before.</p>

            <p>"Elizabeth, wait – "</p>

            <p>She reached the driver's door and turned back to face him. The morning light caught the exhaustion in her face, the way her mascara had smudged beneath her eyes. "Find your own way home."</p>

            <p>Kent's composure cracked completely, his voice climbing to a pitch she'd rarely heard. "You can't just leave me here! This is my car too!"</p>

            <p>"No," Elizabeth said, sliding into the driver's seat. "It's my car. My name on the registration. My insurance." She slammed the door and looked at him through the open window. For the first time in two years, she saw him as he was, and not the romantic figure she'd built up in her mind. "And you gave up any claim to it when you drove off with another woman."</p>

            <p>Kent threw his arms out, his voice breaking into a shout that echoed off the empty buildings around them. "Hey! Bitch! Don't walk away from me! Get back here!"</p>

            <p>Elizabeth started the engine, the sound drowning out whatever else he was yelling. She put the car in drive and steered toward the sunrise, toward home, toward Texas and whatever came next. In the rearview mirror, she watched Kent grow smaller until he disappeared entirely. For the first time in months, the road felt like hers alone.</p>
