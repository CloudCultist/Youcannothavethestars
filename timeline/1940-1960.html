        <h1>United States Timeline: 1940–1960</h1>
        <h2>The Hull–Eisenhower–Wallace Era in Socialist America</h2>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h3>1940</h3>
        <p><strong>November 5 –</strong> Democrat Cordell Hull is elected president, ending two decades of Socialist rule. As tensions escalate in Europe with the rise of Nazism, many Americans fear the Socialist Party would be too lenient toward fascist aggression due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and close U.S.-USSR relations. The Republican Party, having drifted rightward and appearing sympathetic to authoritarian regimes, fails to regain public trust. Voters turn to the Democratic Party as a moderate alternative, cementing its role as primary opposition. The marginalized Republican Party gradually fades from national relevance.</p>

        <h3>1941</h3>
        <p><strong>Spring–Summer –</strong> Hull authorizes the Unified Defense Act, expanding the cooperative industrial base to support defense manufacturing. U.S. diplomats deliver quiet warnings to Germany that an attack on the USSR could trigger American intervention.</p>
        <p><strong>December 7–10 –</strong> Japan attacks Pearl Harbor. The U.S. declares war on Japan the next day. Germany, believing America won't fight on two fronts, gambles by invading the Soviet Union on December 10. Hull responds by declaring war on Germany and Italy on December 11, solidifying the U.S.–USSR alliance.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>1942–1943</h3>
        <p><strong>July 1942 –</strong> The American Labor Federation and cooperative industries agree to the "Total Unity Compact": all wartime production will be democratically managed but centrally directed for the conflict's duration. The U.S. mobilizes its hybrid economy with state-owned sectors guaranteeing massive production for the war effort, while private cooperatives and union shops drive innovation. The war economy cements the legitimacy of the Dual Economy Compromise, which balances public ownership with worker-led enterprise.</p>
        <p><strong>January 1943 –</strong> The Casablanca Conference: Hull, Churchill, and Stalin agree on "unconditional worker's peace" as the Allied aim. U.S. forces land in North Africa while Soviet forces break the siege of Stalingrad.</p>
        <p><strong>Fall 1943 –</strong> Italy collapses. New socialist republics are declared in parts of southern France and northern Italy under Allied protection.</p>

        <p><strong>May–August 1945 –</strong> Germany surrenders unconditionally. Hull refuses to use weapons of mass annihilation against civilian targets, maintaining that "victory without wholesale slaughter" demonstrates democracy's moral leadership.</p>

        <p><strong>February –</strong> The U.S. recognizes the People's Free Republic of China, governed by a broad leftist coalition including Communists, Agrarians, and Social Democrats.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>1950</h3>
        <p><strong>January–October –</strong> The Korean Crisis: Remnant capitalist and monarchist forces, backed by non-socialist nations and Japanese collaborationist holdouts, launch an insurgency and briefly seize Seoul.

The Union of Arctic Nations forms between Canada, Greenland, and Alaska for polar research coordination.</p>
        <p><strong>August 6 –</strong> On the tenth anniversary of what would have been the Hiroshima bombing, investigative journalist Edward R. Murrow reveals the existence of America's wartime atomic weapons program in a CBS radio exposé titled <em>"The Secret That Saved the World."</em> Murrow's investigation, based on leaked Manhattan Project documents and interviews with former scientists, discloses that President Hull possessed operational nuclear weapons in August 1945 but chose not to deploy them against Japan. The revelation triggers a massive public debate: supporters praise Hull's moral courage in refusing to unleash "atomic horror" on civilians, while critics argue the decision prolonged the war and cost additional American and Soviet lives in the Pacific campaign. The disclosure also reveals that the weapons remain in secret government stockpiles under strict presidential control, leading to congressional demands for oversight and public debate about America's nuclear future in an increasingly tense relationship with other world powers.</p>
