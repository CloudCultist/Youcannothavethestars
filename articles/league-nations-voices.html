        <h1>Voices from the Street</h1>
        <p class="source-note">In the wake of the Senate's vote to join the League of Nations, Americans shared their hopes, doubts, and memories. Here is what they had to say.</p>

      <section class="voice-quotes">

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“They told us the League was a dream for professors and preachers. Well, I’m neither, and I say it’s a dream worth living.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Samuel Whitaker, machinist, Detroit, Michigan</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I work ten hours a day cutting steel, and I’ve seen what war takes from men. If America joining keeps the peace, even a little longer, then I’ll take it. Let the professors talk, let the preachers pray. I just want my son to grow up in a world where the cannon stays cold.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“I buried my boy in France. If this League means no other mother has to do that, then God bless it.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Margaret Donnelly, widow, Boston, Massachusetts</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“They said the Great War was the war to end wars. I stood by the harbor when his body came home and I prayed it was true. Maybe it wasn’t, but now there’s a chance again. It won’t bring him back, but maybe it will keep another woman from sitting at the graveside like I did.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“I don’t trust the Europeans. They dragged us into their last quarrel, and they’ll drag us into the next.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Charles Wainwright, farmer, Des Moines, Iowa</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I sell corn to the market, not to the diplomats. But I read the papers and I hear the talk. These entanglements across the ocean are snares, nothing more. Our forefathers warned us plain: don’t tie the Republic to Old World intrigues. Today it’s peace, tomorrow it’s another battlefield.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Some men say it’s a loss of sovereignty. I call it a gain of common sense.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Dr. Edwin Kaplan, physician, New York City</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I’ve seen typhus and influenza sweep through neighborhoods without regard for borders or flags. Disease doesn’t respect sovereignty, and neither does war. If the nations can sit down like civilized men instead of killing one another, that’s not weakness, it’s the only strength worth having.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“Mr. Coolidge may sit in Washington, but he’s shown the world America isn’t afraid to lead.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Frances Hollings, stenographer, Chicago, Illinois</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I copy letters all day for men in offices who talk about the ‘American Century.’ Well, this feels like it. For the first time since the war, it seems like we’re not just counting dollars but standing for something bigger. I don’t know if it will last, but I like the sound of it.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“I don’t care for treaties or foreign speeches. I just want bread on the table and shoes for my children.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Robert Hughes, dockworker, Baltimore, Maryland</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“The bosses will still squeeze us, the ships will still come late, and the wages will still be short. That’s the truth I live with. If this League means the rich sleep easier while the poor scrape by, then it won’t mean much to me. But if it keeps another warship from shelling our boys, maybe that’s worth something.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“This is what President Debs wanted when he spoke of international brotherhood. Took a war and his blood to get us here.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Anna Kowalski, schoolteacher, Cleveland, Ohio</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I was a girl when Debs came through our town, and my father said he spoke like a prophet. He talked about working men and women, but also about the world, how it could be better. They said he was a dreamer. Maybe so. But today, standing with the nations, it feels like his dream reached farther than he ever knew.”</p>
        </figure>

        <figure class="voice-quote">
          <blockquote><em>“You can call me skeptical, but I think it’s about time we stopped acting like a provincial backwater.”</em></blockquote>
          <figcaption class="speaker"><strong>— Lt. Harold Whitcomb (ret.), veteran, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong></figcaption>
          <p class="comment">“I fought in the Argonne and I know what shells sound like. That’s the last thing I want for my son. Some folks say America should mind her own business. Well, we tried that before 1917 and look where it got us, burying boys in French soil. Better to take a seat at the table than let the meal be served without you.”</p>
