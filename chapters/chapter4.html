            </header>

            <p>Timothy Hall was at the place where he felt more at home than his house: his office. Somewhere behind him, a printer whirred to life with its familiar mechanical complaints, adding to the symphony of keyboard clicks and muffled phone conversations that permeated the space. He had once again come in early and promised to stay late, telling himself it was about the satisfaction of untangling financial knots that could save worker-owned businesses. The young man, only thirty-one and still carrying traces of the idealism that had drawn him to cooperative analysis, had done everything he believed was right, including college, career, and then marriage. He saved his money so he could splurge, and he splurged to convince himself the long hours meant something.</p>

            <p>It was close to lunchtime when Tim realized he had to go to the bathroom. He smiled; once again, he had worked all morning without a thought of the external world.</p>

            <p>Rising from his chair, joints stiff from hours hunched over spreadsheets, he walked down the middle aisle past cubicles decorated with family photos and small plants. The air carried a faint chemical tang from the morning's cleaning solution, and the carpet muffled his steps as he slipped out to the hallway restroom. Once he had relieved himself, he was making his way back when his MindBeam chimed with that soft tone Tara had programmed for herself. He ignored it. Whatever domestic crisis needed his attention could wait until he’d proven that Morrison’s bleeding funds were poor management rather than something that couldn’t be fixed.</p>

            <p>As Tim approached his cubicle, he noticed several people clustered around Narine Melikyan's desk. Even Regina Stephenson, their section supervisor, was there, her usual calm replaced by confusion. Her red hair caught the overhead lights as she leaned forward, squinting at something on Narine's monitor.</p>

            <p>Ignoring the distraction, Tim settled into his chair with its familiar creak. He moved the mouse to wake his screen, but instead of the cooperative audit spreadsheet, there was a black screen with green numbers counting down.</p>

            <p>"What in the hell is this?" He tried pressing the ESC key and then the CTRL key with every combination he could think of, but nothing happened. Finally, he stood up and called to the people standing a couple of cubicles away, "Anyone else got this weird countdown on their screen?"</p>

            <p>Narine nodded, her face filled with apparent nervousness. "It's on everything. Marcus in IT says it's even taken over MindBeam's."</p>

            <p>Startled at the thought, Tim pressed his temple, activating his device. The same countdown materialized on his hand, and he heard the mechanical voice in his head: "Fifty-five minutes, fifty-two seconds, fifty-five minutes, fifty-one seconds." He deactivated it immediately. Across the room, someone had turned on a radio; it was broadcasting the same mechanical countdown.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, his MindBeam chimed again. This time, he answered. "Tara, are you okay?"</p>

            <p>"What's happening, Tim? Both of the TVs are showing this weird countdown, and it's even on my MindBeam." Her voice carried that particular strain he'd learned to recognize, the edge that meant she was fighting panic.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, it's here, too. Some kind of system-wide hack."</p>

            <p>"I'm scared. Can you come home? Please?"</p>

            <p>Tim looked at his screen, the project timeline on his wall. "Honey, I can't. Stephenson asked me to finish Morrison today. If I leave now, two hundred people might lose their jobs."</p>

            <p>"Tim, what if this is serious?"</p>

            <p>"If it were really dangerous, whoever is behind this would have just attacked, not flash a countdown. I'm sure it's nothing serious." When she didn't respond, he sighed and added, "Look, as soon as I'm done here, I'll leave and come home. I promise, it'll be no later than three, okay?"</p>

            <p>There was a long pause, and when Tara spoke again, her voice was quieter, resigned. "Fine. I can't stay in the house, though. I'm going to go sit outside for a while."</p>

            <p>"Outside? Tara, that's ridiculous. Just watch something on the TV."</p>

            <p>"The TV has the countdown, too, Tim. Everything does." There was another pause, and Tim heard the front door open, the beep of their alarm system chirping. "There's someone working out front anyway. I'll just see what he's doing. At least I won't be completely alone."</p>

            <p>"Okay, that's good. I really mean it; I'll be home as soon as I'm done. I really need to get back to this."</p>

            <p>But Tara didn't answer him. Instead, she started talking to someone over there. "Have you seen that weird countdown?"</p>

            <p>"I did," a male voice answered. "It's on my phone. I had to take my headphones out of my ears because I couldn't hear my music anymore." Tim didn't hear Tara respond. He was about to tell her he was getting off the phone call, but then the man asked, "You look upset. Are you okay?"</p>

            <p>"It's this countdown thing, but my husband thinks it's nothing."</p>

            <p>"He's probably right. I don't think it's anything to worry about. Probably just a government emergency bulletin test or something."</p>

            <p>"Yeah, maybe." Tara didn't sound convinced, but to Tim's relief, she changed the subject. "So, what are you doing out here, um, Javier?" It sounded to Tim as if she was reading his name, probably from a work badge or letters sewn into his shirt.</p>

            <p>"Oh, I'm just checking the water main, ma'am."</p>

            <p>Tim spoke up. "Hey, honey. I'm going to let you go. I'll be home as quickly as possible. Love you." He hung up without waiting for a response.</p>

            <p>Just then, Regina Stephenson emerged from her office, looking upset. "Everyone, listen up," she called out, her voice carrying across the office. "I've been on the phone with our clients, and about half of them are asking to postpone meetings because of this countdown thing. Everyone is worried about it."</p>

            <p>Narine Melikyan looked up from her desk. "Should we be evacuating or something? I mean, what if it's a bomb threat?"</p>

            <p>"That's what I asked emergency services," Stephenson replied, running her hand through her red hair. "They said if it were a real threat, they'd have issued evacuation orders by now. Best guess is it's some kind of widespread system test or publicity stunt."</p>

            <p>Tim nodded, feeling vindicated in his decision to keep working. Panic never solved anything, and someone had to maintain perspective during a crisis.</p>

            <p>Stephenson continued. "Anyone who wants to leave early can, and if you want to stay, that’s fine. Let's just try to keep things normal and not panic." Several people gathered their things and left. Tim chose to stay.</p>

            <p>As the countdown entered its final minutes, he started to get nervous despite everything he had told Tara. He stood up and walked over to where a few of his remaining coworkers were gathered in Stephenson's office, staring at her computer monitor.</p>

            <p>"Five minutes," someone whispered. The rest of the countdown was spent with idle chatter interspersed with forced humor and nervous laughter. The room was filled with tension, and even Tim realized the atmosphere was starting to get to him.</p>

            <p>When the final seconds arrived, everyone stopped talking. As Tim looked around at the few remaining coworkers, he realized they had all pressed together, trying to gather comfort from human contact. He understood that, and then a wave of guilt over ignoring Tara hit him.</p>

            <p>Finally, the numbers hit zero and the countdown vanished, replaced by Earth slowly rotating in space. Tim blinked, momentarily disoriented by the sudden shift from stark countdown to serene planetary view. Around him, the office had gone completely silent.</p>

            <p>Then a voice began speaking, talking about believing in life beyond Earth. Tim recognized the voice, maybe from a documentary he'd seen years ago, but he couldn't place it.</p>

            <p>The camera pulled back, revealing Mars, then Jupiter and the other gas giants. There was a fifth he didn't recognize, but it was gone as soon as it appeared. As he watched, his rational mind tried to process what he was seeing.</p>

            <p>"Jesus Christ," Stephenson breathed from next to him. "Are we really watching this?"</p>

            <p>A Russian voice came next, equally thoughtful, equally convinced that humanity wasn't alone. Then the view pulled back further, showing the entire galaxy, stars lighting up like beacons across the spiral arms.</p>

            <p>And then the being appeared on screen. Tim's first thought was that the special effects were remarkable. It began to speak, words coming through even though the mouth wasn't moving.</p>

            <p>As it spoke, the alien's voice resonated through the office speakers, calm and reassuring, discussing peace, cooperation, and the end of humanity's cosmic loneliness. Tim found himself leaning forward, his career concerns evaporating as the magnitude of the moment sank in.</p>

            <p>When the broadcast ended, the office remained silent for nearly a full minute. Then Stephenson spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think we can call it a day, everyone."</p>
