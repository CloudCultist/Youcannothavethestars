        <h2>About <em>You Cannot Have the Stars</em></h2>
        <p>The novel grows out of questions about turning points in history: how societies change, how people respond, and how the future shifts when one decision alters the path of history. <em>You Cannot Have the Stars</em> is an alternate past colliding with an unimaginable future — a story of political upheaval, alien contact, and the fragile trust that holds civilizations together.</p>

        <p>This website expands on the novel with in-universe articles, fictional lectures, declassified documents, and character writings. The goal is not simply to explain the book, but to create a living archive that invites readers to explore its world more deeply.</p>

        <p>Everything on this site is written to <strong>avoid spoilers</strong>. Readers can freely browse articles, lectures, and background material without fear of ruining the novel’s key revelations.</p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>I’ve been reading science fiction for as long as I can remember. The first two books that drew me fully into the genre were Ray Bradbury’s <em>The Martian Chronicles</em> and Charles Sheffield’s <em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em>. Since then, I’ve been shaped by a wide range of writers whose work stretches across the speculative spectrum: Peter F. Hamilton, Stephen Baxter, Kim Stanley Robinson, Michael Crichton, and Harry Turtledove among them.</p>

        <p>My background in history, which I studied in college, and my love of science fiction has inspired me to create — and ultimately expand — the world of <em>You Cannot Have the Stars</em>. From novels to novellas and short stories, there is no limit to the stories that can be told.</p>
